Abstract = {{Objective: To describe trends in hospitalisation for sport-related
   concussion.
   Design, setting and patients: Analysis of routinely collected hospital
   admissions data from all Victorian hospitals (public and private) over
   the 2002 03 to 2010-11 financial years for patients aged >= 15 years
   with a diagnosis of concussion and an ICD-10-AM external cause activity
   code indicating sport.
   Main outcome measures: Number and cost of hospitalisations; rate of
   hospitalisation per 100 000 participants overall and for specific
   sports; and percentage change in frequency and hospitalisation rate per
   100 000 participants over 9 years.
   Results: There were 4745 hospitalisations of people aged 15 years for
   sport-related concussion, with a total hospital treatment cost of \$17
   944 799. The frequency of hospitalisation increased by 60.5\% (95\% CI,
   41.7\%-77.3\%) over the 9 years, but could only partially be explained
   by increases in sports participation, as the rate per 100 000
   participants also increased significantly, by 38.9\% (95\% CI,
   17.5\%-61.7\%). After adjustment for participation, rates were highest
   for motor sports, equestrian activities, Australian football, rugby and
   roller sports. The greatest significant increases in rates were seen in
   roller sports, rugby, soccer and cycling.
   Conclusions: The frequency,and participation-adjusted rate of
   hospitalisation for sport-related concussion, both overall and across
   several sports, increased significantly over the 9 years: These
   findings, along with high levels of public concern, make prevention of
   head injury in sport a population health priority in Australia.}},

Title = {{Examining the Financial Impact of Alcohol Sales on Football Game Days: A
   Case Study of a Major Football Program}},

Volume = {{27}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{As college athletic departments continue to seek additional sources of
   revenue to remain competitive, alcohol sales on game day increasingly
   has been considered as a potentially lucrative and untapped revenue
   source. Despite the seemingly high profitability from alcohol sales, the
   increased availability of alcohol coupled with its consumption by a
   large number of individuals has negative social consequences, including
   assaults, arrests, and other behavioral risks, causing potential ethical
   and social responsibility dilemmas for athletic departments and
   universities. Utilizing self-disclosed financial data (via interviews
   and documents) from a major college football program, this case study
   examines the financial implications of selling alcohol to the general
   public on football game days. Through proforma financial analysis, two
   revenue models are created to show the incremental revenue potential of
   alcohol sales. Results show that for this institution the incremental
   financial impact from alcoholic beverage sales does not create
   sufficient benefit to pursue this avenue of funding. This conclusion,
   however, must be examined within the larger resources, contextual
   constraints, and expectations of particular institutions for both
   competitive advantage and social responsibility.}},

Abstract = {{Financial vulnerability is a critical issue for nonprofit sports clubs
   due to clubs' increasing costs and impediments to generating sufficient
   income. The first objective of this study is to derive a conceptual
   understanding of financial vulnerability for sports clubs by assessing
   three financial vulnerability models, two of which have previously been
   applied in the nonprofit sector generally. Two models are based on
   revenue patterns and expenditure, and the third is based on movements in
   Net Assets over four years. A second objective is to identify
   determinants of financial vulnerability within amateur sports clubs,
   focusing specifically on golf and football.
   The data to test these models were derived from the financial reports of
   227 amateur sports clubs in New Zealand (98 football and 129 golf
   clubs). Each of the three models results in different predictive
   variables and has different explanatory strengths. For example, football
   clubs that were financially vulnerable under Model 1: Program
   Expenditure had declining revenues from members and trading, as well as
   high administration costs. Conversely, declining reserves are predictive
   in financially vulnerable golf clubs using Model 2: Net Assets. Model 3:
   Net Earnings was generalizable to both football and golf clubs. The
   explanatory variables were different between these sports, due to their
   different asset base and propensity to employ paid staff. The common
   variables those with oversight responsibilities should monitor against
   financial vulnerability are: an undue reliance on external, rather than
   member-based revenue, increasing debt, and excessive expenditure.
   Further research could extend this model to other sports and other
   jurisdictions. (C) 2012 Sport Management Association of Australia and

Title = {{Priming Intelligent Behavior: An Elusive Phenomenon}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 24}},
Abstract = {{Can behavior be unconsciously primed via the activation of attitudes,
   stereotypes, or other concepts? A number of studies have suggested that
   such priming effects can occur, and a prominent illustration is the
   claim that individuals' accuracy in answering general knowledge
   questions can be influenced by activating intelligence-related concepts
   such as professor or soccer hooligan. In 9 experiments with 475
   participants we employed the procedures used in these studies, as well
   as a number of variants of those procedures, in an attempt to obtain
   this intelligence priming effect. None of the experiments obtained the
   effect, although financial incentives did boost performance. A Bayesian
   analysis reveals considerable evidential support for the null
   hypothesis. The results conform to the pattern typically obtained in
   word priming experiments in which priming is very narrow in its

Abstract = {{Background: Most studies on Achilles tendon ruptures involved US
   military or European populations, which may not translate to the general
   US population. The current study reviews 406 consecutive Achilles tendon
   ruptures occurring in the general US population for patterns in a
   tertiary care subspecialty referral setting.
   Methods: An institutional review board-approved, retrospective review of
   the charts of 331 (83\%) males (6 bilateral, nonsimultaneous) and 69
   (17\%) females diagnosed with Achilles tendon ruptures over a 10-year
   period was undertaken. Average age was 46.4 years with 310 (76\%)
   ruptures diagnosed and managed acutely (less than 4 weeks), whereas 96
   (24\%) were chronic (more than 4 weeks since the injury). Patients were
   assessed for mechanism of injury and previously described underlying
   risk factors. Results were assessed according to age (greater or less
   than 55 years), body mass index (BMI), and time to diagnosis.
   Results: Sporting activity was responsible for 275 ruptures (68\%). This
   was higher in patients younger than 55 years of age (77\%) than those
   older than 55 years (42\%). Basketball was the most commonly involved
   sport, accounting for 132 ruptures (48\% of sports ruptures, 32\% of all
   ruptures), followed by tennis in 52 ruptures (13\%, 9\%), and football
   in 32 ruptures (12\%, 8\%). In all, 20 ruptures were reruptures of the
   same Achilles tendon, of which 17 had previously been treated
   nonsurgically. In this study, recent quinolone use (2\%) and African
   American race (31\%) were not major risk factors for rupture as
   described in other studies. Older patients and patients with a BMI
   greater than 30 were more likely to be injured in nonsporting activities
   and more likely to have their diagnosis initially not recognized
   resulting in their presentation more than 4 weeks following the injury.
   Conclusion: In this study, sports participation was the most common
   mechanism, but not to the same extent seen in the European or US
   military studies. Basketball was the most commonly involved sport, as
   compared to soccer in Europe. Age and BMI had a directly proportional
   correlation with time to diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{We hypothesize that results of football (soccer) teams affect the risk
   perception of people. People choose riskier investments after a win and
   less risky investments after a loss; this leads to higher (lower)
   returns in the stock market. These hypotheses are tested for the
   international matches of Turkey's three most popular teams (Besiktas,
   Fenerbahce, and Galatasaray). The empirical findings suggests that the
   teams' wins led to higher asset returns and lower risk aversion on the
   following business day of the Borsa Istanbul and lower returns and
   higher risk aversion after a loss or a tie.}},

Title = {{Does Midseason Change of Coach Improve Team Performance? Evidence From
   the NBA}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SPORT MANAGEMENT}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important management dilemmas for owners and general
   managers of sports teams is whether to make a midseason coaching change
   when the team is faltering. Changing a coach midseason is an important
   managerial decision and, like most decisions, there are benefits and
   costs. The costs are short-term financial costs to owners. If a coaching
   change is made, owners must compensate the dismissed coach and the
   newly-hired coach. For example, the Detroit Pistons paid about \$6
   million dollars to Larry Brown in 2005 after firing him
   (http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13896726.html). In 2008, Kings paid
   three head coaching salaries that season to Kenny Natt, Reggie Theus and
   Bill Musselman (http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/28239643). The expected
   benefit of a midseason coaching change exists in the form of improved
   team performance. However, there is no theoretical consensus about
   whether a coaching change improves team performance and empirical work
   on the subject has been inconclusive.
   The goal of this paper is to add to the empirical literature on the
   performance effects of midseason coaching changes by examining data from
   the NBA. We develop a simple model to compare the performance of former
   coaches to current coaches. We use an extensive data set including all
   midseason coaching changes in the history of the NBA. And finally, we
   identify factors correlated with making a successful midseason coaching
   change which should provide useful guidelines for sport managers. Not
   surprisingly, in some instances a new coach improves team performance
   and in some cases a new coach negatively affects team performance.
   However, we find that the new coach has a higher winning percentage in
   about sixty-one percent of the coaching changes examined. Our empirical
   results indicate that a new coach is more likely to improve performance
   if the coach spent time in the NBA as a player, but the new coach is
   less likely to improve performance the greater the difference in number
   of games coached by the former and current coaches.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have shown a higher prevalence of radiological
   abnormalities among gymnasts. However, the types of radiological
   abnormalities associated with low back pain (LBP) have not been
   clarified. The hypothesis was that significant relationships between
   radiological abnormalities and LBP may be revealed by discriminating
   between the types of MRI abnormalities while considering confounding
   factors. The subjects were 104 Japanese collegiate gymnasts (men, 70;
   women, 34). The presence of LBP was evaluated using the questionnaire
   developed by Osaka City University (OCU Test). Magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) abnormalities were evaluated using T1- and T2-weighted
   MRI. The prevalence of more than 1 MRI abnormality in gymnasts was 47.1
   \% (49/104). The chi-square test showed that the incidence of lumbar
   disc degeneration (LDDG) and limbus vertebra was significantly greater
   in gymnasts with LBP than in gymnasts without LBP. By using logistic
   regression analysis to analyze the concomitant environmental variables,
   only LDDG (odds ratio, 2.70; 95 \% confidence interval, 1.10-6.66) was
   selected as a statistically significant variable accounting for LBP. In
   conclusion, LDDG is a predictor for LBP in Japanese collegiate gymnasts.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the prevalence of medication and nutritional
   supplement use in male Football Super League players and to observe the
   long term changes of players' attitudes during 5 years period (4
   seasons).
   Study Design: Retrospective study.
   Material and Methods: Review and analysis of 4176 doping control forms
   -declaration reports- about players' medication intake including; Super
   League, UEFA Cup and the UEFA Champions League matches. Team physician
   was asked to document all medications and nutritional supplements taken
   by the Football Super League players in the last 72 hours before each
   match.
   Results: A total intake of 5939 substances were documented, of which
   almost half 49.2\% (n=2921) were classified as medications and 50.8\%
   (n=3018) were nutritional supplements. The average consumption per
   player was 1.42 substance/match; 0.70 were medications and 0.72 of
   nutritional supplements. The supplements used most frequently were
   NSAIDs 24.6\% (n=1460) accounting for almost one in four of all reported
   supplements. Diclofenac Sodium was the most frequently reported active
   pharmaceutical ingredient. Second most frequently used supplements were
   vitamins (22.2\%). The average drug consumption reported per player has
   been increasing every passing year. It was 0.7 substance/match/player
   (0.4 medication; 0.3 nutritional supplement) in 2003-2004 season; was
   increased to 1.8 substance/match (0.8 medication; 1.0 nutritional
   supplement) in 2006-2007 season.
   Conclusion: The trends seen in this survey point to an overuse of NSAIDs
   and vitamins in comparison with other medications, amoung Turkish Super
   League football players (p<0.001). The use of NSAIDs has increased but
   the medication groups did not differ significantly between seasons, in
   terms of distribution. This increasing use of medications especially of
   non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and nutritional supplements is
   alarming and needs to be argued.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports the findings of a study that explored the nexus
   between sport and social capital in Vanuatu. Specifically, it explored
   the social networks that operate through football, and the resources
   that are available to members through these networks. The research
   involved in-depth interviews with players and administrators within one
   of the Vanuatu football leagues. The results show that football clubs
   are sites for significant social capital development, whereby players
   receive resources such as employment, accommodation, food and
   transportation, as well as financial incentives and travel opportunities
   outside Vanuatu. In particular, it is evident that players are able to
   access employment opportunities that their level of education would not
   normally make possible. Players secure access to these social networks
   by gaining the trust of key club administrators and demonstrating their
   loyalty to the club. The research demonstrates that a type of football
   wantok exists, which like the traditional wantok, describes a dense
   social or familial network in which access to essential resources are
   only available to members of the network.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Athletes participating in sport are exposed to a high injury
   risk. Previous research has found a great number of risk factors (both
   physiological and psychological) that could increase injury risk.(1) One
   limitation in previous studies is that few have considered the complex
   interaction between psychological factors in their research design.
   Objective: To study whether personality, stress, and coping predicted
   injury occurrence in an elite soccer population based on a hypothesized
   model. Design: Prospective. Participants: 56 (n = 38 male, n = 18
   female) Swedish Premiere League soccer players were selected based on
   convenience sampling. Intervention: Participants completed 4
   questionnaires including the Swedish Universities Scales of
   Personality,(2) Life Events Survey for Collegiate Athletes,(3) and Brief
   COPE4 during the initial questionnaire administration. Subsequent to the
   first meeting, participants also completed the Hassle and Uplift
   Scale(5) once per wk for a 13-wk period throughout the competitive
   season. Main Outcome Measures: A path analysis was conducted examining
   the influence of personality traits (ie, trait anxiety), state-level
   stressors (ie, negative-life-event stress and daily hassles), and coping
   on injury frequency. Results: Results of the path analysis indicated
   that trait anxiety, negative-life-event stress, and daily hassle were
   significant predictors of injury among professional soccer players,
   accounting for 24\% of the variance. Conclusion: The findings highlight
   the need for athletes, coaches, and medical practitioners to attempt to
   reduce state-level stressors, especially daily hassles, in minimizing
   injury risk. Educating and training athletes and coaches in proactive
   stress-management techniques appears warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This study seeks to examine the influence of the gamut of
   changes that have taken place in the past 15 years in the world of
   international football that have permanently transformed football from a
   game into a real business, while also considering some specific events
   that have affected Italian football in terms of the valuation of
   players' registration rights in the financial statements of the leading
   Italian football clubs throughout the period 1996-2009.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research was conducted taking into
   account the leading Italian clubs. The clubs considered were those that,
   in the period examined, qualified at least five times for a place in the
   Italian Serie A championship which is instrumental to their direct
   participation, or through the qualifying round, in the Champions League.
   Findings - The research shows that questionable window dressing
   policies, consisting of artificially overestimated values of players'
   registration rights, aggravated the Italian football crisis that
   exploded during the 2001/2002 season. However, the origins of this
   crisis must be ascribed to the inability of Italian teams to control
   players' wages.
   Research limitations/implications - The study concerns only the leading
   clubs and examines the value of players' registration rights as an
   aggregate, as it is not always possible to extrapolate from financial
   statements the values attributed to individual players.
   Originality/value - The Italian legal system, unlike others, establishes
   for corporations, the obligation to recapitalize if losses exceed a
   certain level. Based on this particular regulation, this research,
   suggesting a different interpretation of events, identifies the window
   dressing policies implemented by Italian football clubs during the
   period in question as behavior designed to evade the obligation to cover
   losses, and highlights the real purpose of the exceptional measures
   undertaken by the Italian legislator to save the entire industry.}},

Abstract = {{The UEFA approved the Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play Regulation
   in 2010, which governs the requirements on transparency and financial
   conditions of football clubs participating at the European cups. The
   paper focuses on the specifics of Czech professional football clubs. The
   research is carried out in two ways. Firstly, the compliance with
   information duties set up by Czech commercial law is analysed. According
   to the performed empirical survey, a significant number of Czech
   football clubs submit their financial statements to the Business
   Register with a delay or they do not submit the statements at all
   despite the submission is mandatory. This unsatisfactory state of
   affairs boosts the risk of bankruptcy of football clubs rapidly taking
   into account an overall poor financial health of Czech football clubs,
   which is evidenced by the second part of empirical study.}},

Title = {{Assessing the Extent and Sources of NCAA Rule Infractions A National
   Self-Report Study of Student-Athletes}},

Abstract = {{Although the popular and academic media often proclaim that rule
   violations are widespread in college athletics, research assessing the
   true prevalence and causes of such infractions is in short supply. To
   address this knowledge gap, we conducted a national survey that asked a
   random sample of male student-athletes at Division I basketball and
   football programs about such infractions (n = 648). The results revealed
   that although six in ten student-athletes did not commit any infractions
   in the recruitment process, seven in ten respondents reported breaking
   NCAA rules while in college. Most violations, however, were relatively
   minor and involved amenities that would enhance the student-athletes'
   quality of life (free meals, cash payments less than \$20). In contrast,
   serious violations-such as free cars, substantial financial allocations,
   and academic fraud-were rare, although they did exist. The multivariate
   analysis revealed that infractions were higher among student-athletes
   who were highly recruited; who associated with fellow athletes that
   transgressed NCAA rules or saw nothing inappropriate about breaking
   these regulations; who personally embraced values defining rule
   violations as acceptable; who did not have close relationships with
   their parents; and, in particular, who had a general propensity to be
   involved in deviant behavior. In contrast, infractions were
   statistically unrelated to a variety of factors, including most notably
   economic deprivation, organizational context, and threats of sanctions.
   A potentially disquieting finding is that a quarter of the respondents
   admitted to gambling on sporting events, with a small percentage
   reporting placing bets on games in which they played and three
   respondents stating that they had ``received money from a gambler for
   not playing well.{''}}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of corporate governance
   quality (namely board size, board independence, managerial ownership,
   institutional ownership, and CEO duality) on the profitability and
   viability of European Union's football clubs over the period 2005-2009.
   Empirical results documented that corporate governance quality (higher
   managerial and institutional ownership, increased board size and
   independence, and the separation of the CEO and chairman roles) leads to
   greater levels of profitability and viability. Further analysis based on
   clubs' profitability and viability indicates that sound governance
   mechanisms are also important for those clubs with intense problems of
   insolvency and low financial performance. The results of this study
   dictate the necessity of corporate governance principles for protecting
   the interests of shareholders and various stakeholders and for
   maximizing the clubs' economic results and social return. The empirical
   findings are robust to several sensitivity tests concerning the
   specification of the models and the measures of financial performance.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the financial and cultural importance of intercollegiate
   athletics in the United States, there is a paucity of research into how
   athletic scholarships are awarded. In this article, the authors
   empirically examine the factors that universities use in their decision
   to offer athletic scholarships to high school football players. Using a
   Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) model, the authors find a
   player's weight, height, body mass index (BMI), race, speed,
   on-the-field performance, and his high school team's success often have
   large and significant impacts on the number of scholarship offers he
   receives. There is also evidence of a negative relationship between
   academic performance and scholarship offers. In addition, the authors
   find evidence of a scholarship premium for players from Florida and
   Texas. The results also show that running backs, wide receivers, and
   defensive backs appear to generate the most attention from college
   football coaches, other things equal.}},

Title = {{``HealthKick{''}: Formative assessment of the health environment in
   low-resource primary schools in the Western Cape Province of South
   Africa}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: This study evaluated the primary school environment in terms
   of being conducive to good nutrition practices, sufficient physical
   activity and prevention of nicotine use, with the view of planning a
   school-based health intervention.
   Methods: A sample of 100 urban and rural disadvantaged schools was
   randomly selected from two education districts of the Western Cape
   Education Department, South Africa. A situation analysis, which
   comprised an interview with the school principal and completion of an
   observation schedule of the school environment, was done at all schools.
   Results: Schools, on average, had 560 learners and 16 educators.
   Principals perceived the top health priorities for learners to be an
   unhealthy diet (50\%) and to far lesser degree, lack of physical
   activity (24\%) and underweight (16\%). They cited lack of physical
   activity (33\%) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs; 24\%) as the main
   health priorities for educators, while substance abuse (66\%) and
   tobacco use (31\%) were prioritised for parents. Main barriers to health
   promotion programmes included lack of financial resources and too little
   time in the time table. The most common items sold at the school tuck
   shops were crisps (100\%), and then sweets (96\%), while vendors mainly
   sold sweets (92\%), crisps (89\%), and ice lollies (38\%). Very few
   schools (8\%) had policies governing the type of food items sold at
   school. Twenty-six of the 100 schools that were visited had vegetable
   gardens. All schools reported having physical activity and physical
   education in their time tables, however, not all of them offered this
   activity outside the class room. Extramural sport offered at schools
   mainly included athletics, netball, and rugby, with cricket and soccer
   being offered less frequently.
   Conclusion: The formative findings of this study contribute to the
   knowledge of key environmental and policy determinants that may play a
   role in the health behaviour of learners, their parents and their
   educators. Evidently, these show that school environments are not always
   conducive to healthy lifestyles. To address the identified determinants
   relating to learners it is necessary to intervene on the various levels
   of influence, i.e. parents, educators, and the support systems for the
   school environment including the curriculum, food available at school,
   resources for physical activity as well as appropriate policies in this
   regard.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Injuries to the shoulder are common in collegiate football,
   and injuries to the acromioclavicular (AC) joint have previously
   accounted for up to 41\% of all shoulder injuries.
   Purpose: To determine the incidence and epidemiology of injury to the AC
   joint in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) football
   athletes.
   Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study.
   Methods: The NCAA Injury Surveillance System (ISS) men's football
   database was reviewed from the 2004-2009 playing seasons. The exposure
   data set from the same years was reviewed for the purposes of computing
   rates of injury per athlete exposure (AE). The injury rate (number of
   injuries divided by number of AEs) was computed per 10,000 AEs for
   competition and practice exposures. Ninety-five percent confidence
   intervals (95\% CIs) for the incidence rates were calculated using
   assumptions of a Poisson distribution.
   Results: According to the estimates made by the NCAA ISS, a total of 748
   injuries to the AC joint occurred in NCAA football players during
   2,222,155 AEs, accounting for 4.49\% of all injuries sustained during
   this 5-year surveillance period. The overall rate of injury was 3.34 per
   10,000 AEs (95\% CI, 3.10-3.59). Players were 11.68 (95\% CI,
   10.11-13.49) times more likely to sustain an injury in games than
   practices. Partial sprains (types I or II) accounted for 96.4\% of
   injuries, while complete sprains (>= type III) accounted for the
   remaining 3.6\%. The average amount of time lost per injury was 11.61
   days. Complete sprains resulted in a mean time loss of 31.9 days (95\%
   CI, 24.4-39.6) while partial injuries resulted in 11.0 days lost (95\%
   CI, 9.6-12.3). Overall, 2.41\% of injuries underwent surgical
   intervention, with 22.2\% of complete sprains and 1.7\% of partial
   injuries resulting in surgery. Complete sprains of the AC joint were
   13.5 (95\% CI, 4.63-35.26) times more likely to result in surgical
   intervention than partial sprains. The majority of injuries (71.93\%)
   resulted from contact with another player and 47.09\% occurred while
   tackling or being tackled. Of all injuries, 47.63\% occurred during
   offensive plays, while defense accounted for 20.77\%.
   Conclusion: AC joint injuries in NCAA football players are predominantly
   low-grade sprains, leading to approximately 12 days of lost competition.
   The few severe sprains that occurred often resulted in surgery or
   required approximately 5 weeks of rehabilitation.}},

Title = {{Do NFL Player Earnings Compensate for Monopsony Exploitation in College?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SPORTS ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the extent to which a college player's future income
   in professional football offsets his monopsony exploitation experienced
   at the college level. Stated differently, it attempts to measure whether
   a future NFL draftee's professional earnings compensates for his
   monopsony-induced loss in income at the college level. This is an
   important issue in the debate surrounding compensating college players,
   opposed by many on grounds that the top college players ultimately
   receive lucrative financial rewards as professionals.
   First, this paper uses a quantile regression method to account for
   differences in player marginal revenue products across college teams
   with different revenue-generating capabilities; for instance, players at
   high-revenue college teams produce higher marginal revenue products and
   thereby experience greater degrees of monopsony exploitation to overcome
   at the professional level. Next, it approximates professional players'
   earning profiles using NFL salary data, and then weighs these earnings
   against a player's foregone college compensation resulting from
   monopsony-induced restrictions in college football. The results indicate
   that between 33 and 38 percent of this sample of players (active and
   inactive) will earn NFL incomes sufficient to offset their
   monopsony-lost college earnings: A handful of these NFL players earn
   huge net surpluses but most can expect more modest net earnings.}},

   Variation in Franchise Revenues}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SPORTS ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{431-450}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{One of the absolutes in professional sports, and a reason for its
   success, is the uncertainty of the outcome of individual games, seasons,
   and championships. This uncertainty impacts a team's attendance and
   financial operation. While leagues cultivate uncertainty through various
   rules such as salary caps, revenue sharing, and the amateur draft,
   individual franchises have to manage the result of variability in annual
   revenues. Not only is this due to the parity in a league but also from
   injuries and changes in player quality that are unexpected. Whether
   uncertainty or winning or the perfect combination of the two, some
   aspects that affect revenues can be controlled by team management more
   so than others. Even though on-the-field success is not easily
   controlled by team management, the overall quality of the experience can
   be impacted from, among other things, a quality stadium with comfortable
   seating and delectable food. This research shows that the variability in
   annual team revenues decreases (relative to total revenues) once a team
   moves into a new stadium, all else equal. The increase in predictability
   lowers financial risk, impacting the cost of financing and other
   practical operational issues like game-day staffing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the state of competitiveness in top division
   football leagues in ten European countries. Potential factors that might
   affect, or be influenced by, competitive balance are also explored.
   Using alternative indicators of competitive balance, the research found
   that with the passage of time the English Premier League has become less
   competitive, which coincides with the growing incidence of overseas
   investment in English clubs. The French Ligue 1 emerged as the most
   competitive league (out of ten) in Europe on most indicators in 2010,
   whereas the Dutch Eredivise was the least balanced. Further
   investigation revealed a strong statistically significant relationship
   between league competitiveness and league size (number of clubs) and a
   moderately strong, albeit insignificant, effect of a league's
   competitive balance on its popularity (attendance). However, the link
   between competitiveness and the perceived quality of countries' football
   leagues (as per UEFA association rankings) was relatively modest and
   insignificant. The findings provide a useful baseline for examining the
   effect of UEFA's financial fair play regulations on the competitiveness
   of football leagues across key European markets in the years to come.}},

Abstract = {{The NCAA maintains a balance between amateurism and the increasing need
   for generating revenue. In this balancing act, there are various policy
   considerations and legal constraints. These legal and policy
   entanglements bore such class action suits as Keller v. Electronic Arts,
   National Collegiate Athletic Association, and Collegiate Licensing
   Company (2009) and O'Bannon v. National Collegiate Athletic Association
   and Collegiate Licensing Company (2009), which question current revenue
   generating practices of the NCAA. The purpose of this study was to
   examine the perceptions of NCAA Division I men's football and basketball
   student-athletes toward amateurism and the particular use of
   student-athletes' likenesses in college sports video games. Findings
   point to a lack of clarity and understanding of the agreements and
   consent forms student-athletes sign annually. Respondents demonstrated

   Recommendations include clarification and focused rules' education from
   compliance and financial aid officers, as well as introducing new

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the effects of a percentage-of-revenue salary cap in
   a team sports league with win-maximizing clubs and flexible talent
   supply. It shows that a percentage-of-revenue cap produces a more
   balanced league and decreases aggregate salary payments. Taking into
   account the idiosyncrasies of European football, our paper further
   highlights the potential conflicts between the league and society. From
   the perspective of a league governing body, a percentage-of-revenue cap
   always enhances financial stability of win-maximizing clubs. A social
   planner, however, will not permit the introduction of such a cap if fans
   and players unduly suffer. This paper shows under which conditions the
   social planner accepts (rejects) a salary cap proposed by the league
   regulator. (JEL D02, D60, L83)}},

Abstract = {{Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) manifests a wide array of clinical
   features, indicating great heterogeneity of its underlying pathologic
   features. mTBI diversity is related to pre-injury inter-individual
   differences and differences in the characteristics of each injury. This
   review summarizes key features of mTBI patients, their injuries and
   outcomes to give context to the scope of complexity inherent in this
   disorder. These differences are underscored by heterogeneity in
   postmortem pathology and in vivo imaging studies. Recognition,
   understanding and accounting for disease heterogeneity in mTBI are
   needed to enhance diagnosis and patient management, as approaches that
   do not account for inter-individual variation in pathology and patient
   characteristics relevant to real-life clinical trial participants, may
   entirely miss therapeutic targets. Refining our approach to TBI
   diagnosis, in light of inter-individual differences, can facilitate the
   development of effective prognostic tools and algorithms. New paradigms,
   which embrace heterogeneity of mTBI, in both preclinical and clinical
   investigation as well the appreciation of this variability in clinical
   care, offer much promise for enhancing outcomes and mitigating the
   burden of mTBI on its victims.}},

Abstract = {{We undertake a firm-level analysis of the relation between National
   Football League (NFL) game outcomes and the return patterns of Nasdaq
   firms headquartered geographically near the NFL teams. We find that a
   team's loss leads to lower next-day returns for locally headquartered
   stocks and that this impact increases for a surprising loss or a
   critical game loss. The negative effects of game losses are stronger for
   stocks that are more vulnerable to shifts in sports sentiment. Our
   results suggest that the game outcomes of local sports teams influence
   investor sentiment, which significantly affects the returns of localized

Abstract = {{Various stressors trigger cardiac death. The objective was to
   investigate a possible relation between a stock market crash and cardiac
   death in a large population within the United States. We obtained daily
   stock market data (Dow Jones Industrial Average Index), death
   certificate data for daily deaths in Los Angeles County (LA), and annual
   LA population estimates for 2005 through 2008. The 4 years death rate
   curves (2005 through 2008) were averaged into a single curve to
   illustrate annual trends. Data were ``deseasonalized{''} by subtracting
   from the daily observed value the average value for that day of year.
   There was marked seasonal variation in total and cardiac death rates.
   Even in the mild LA climate, death rates were higher in winter versus
   summer including total death (+17\%), circulatory death (+24\%),
   coronary heart disease death (+28\%), and myocardial infarction death
   (+38\%) rates (p <0.0001 for each). Absolute coronary heart disease
   death rates have decreased since 1985. After accounting for seasonal
   variation, the large stock market crash in October 2008 did not affect
   death rates in LA. Death rates remained at or below seasonal averages
   during the stock market crash. In conclusion, after correcting for
   seasonal variation, the stock market crash in October 2008 was not
   associated with an increase in total or cardiac death in LA. Annual
   coronary heart disease death rates continue to decrease. However,
   seasonal variation (specifically winter) remains a trigger for death and
   coronary heart disease death even in LA where winters are mild. (C) 2012

Title = {{Relationship between interchange usage and risk of hamstring injuries in

Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To study risk factors for hamstring injury in the Australian
   Football League (AFL), in particular the effect of recent changes in
   match participation (increased use of the interchange bench) on
   hamstring injury.
   Design: Analysis of hamstring match injury statistics extracted from an
   injury database combined with match participation statistics extracted
   from a player statistics database.
   Methods: 56,320 player matches in the AFL over the period 2003-2010 were
   analyzed, in which 416 hamstring injuries occurred.
   Results: In a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) analysis accounting
   for clustering of different teams, significant predictors of hamstring
   injuries were recent hamstring injury (RR 4.16, 95\% Cl 3.19-5.43), past
   history of ACL, reconstruction (RR 1.69, 95\% CI 1.09-2.60), past
   history of calf injury (RR 1.58, 95\% Cl 1.37-1.82), opposition team
   making 60 or more interchanges during the game (RR 1.38, 95\% CI
   1.12-1.68) and player having made 7 or more interchanges off the field
   in the last 3 weeks (protective RR 0.74, 95\% CI 0.59-0.93).
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that regular interchanges protect
   individual players against hamstring injuries, but increase the risk of
   hamstring injury for opposition players. These findings can be explained
   by a model in which both fatigue and average match running speed are
   risk factors for hamstring injury. A player who returns to the ground
   after a rest on the interchange bench may himself have some short-term
   protection against hamstring injury because of the reduced fatigue, but
   his rested state may contribute to increased average running speed for
   his direct opponent, increasing the risk of injury for players on the
   opposition team. (C) 2011 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by

Abstract = {{Due to their limited financial resources winning the national
   championship or qualifying for an international cup competition is not a
   viable option for most small market clubs in any of the European
   professional team sports leagues, such as soccer, ice hockey, basketball
   or handball. However, since a particularly poor performance is usually
   punished by relegation and since being relegated to the respective
   second division is associated with a dramatic decline in revenues,
   avoiding relegation is a target in itself. Using data from seven
   different professional team sports leagues in four different countries
   we estimate various parametric and semi-parametric regression models to
   identify the determinants of the clubs' length of stay in their
   respective first division. In line with the organizational ecology
   literature we find that club experience, previous club performance
   (number of previous championship titles and number of previous
   relegations) and market size (average attendance) affect survival in a
   statistically significant and economically relevant sense. Perhaps
   surprisingly, founding conditions seem to be irrelevant for a club's
   length of stay in its respective first division.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Clinical outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention
   (PCI) in patients with saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) remain poor despite
   the use of drug-eluting stents (DES). There is a disparity in clinical
   outcomes in SVG PCI based on various registries, and randomized clinical
   data remain scant. We conducted a meta-analysis of all existing
   randomized controlled trials (RCTS) comparing bare-metal stents (BMS)
   and DES in SVGPCIs. Hypothesis: PCI in patients with SVG disease using
   DES may reduce need for repeat revascularization without an excess
   mortality when compared to BMS. Methods: An aggregate data meta-analysis
   of clinical outcomes in RCTs comparing PCI with DES vs BMS for SVGs
   reporting at least 12 months of follow-up was performed. A literature
   search between Janurary 1, 2003 and September 30, 2011 identified 4 RCTs
   (812 patients; DES = 416, BMS = 396). Summary odds ratio (OR) and 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) were calculated using the random-effects model.
   The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes
   included nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), repeat revascularization,
   and major adverse cardiac events (MACE). These outcomes were assessed in
   a cumulative fashion at 30 days, 18 months, and 36 months. Results:
   There were no intergroup differences in baseline clinical and
   sociodemographic characteristics. At a median follow-up of 25 months,
   patients in the DES and BMS group had similar rates of death (OR: 1.63,
   95\% CI: 0.455.92), MI (OR; 0.83, 95\% CI: 0.27-2.60), and MACE (OR:
   0.58, 95\% CI: 0.251.32). Patients treated with DES had lower rates of
   repeat revascularization (OR: 0.40, 95\% CI: 0.220.75). Conclusions: In
   this comprehensive meta-analysis of all RCTs comparing clinical outcomes
   of PCI using DES vs BMS in patients with SVG disease, use of DES was
   associated with a reduction in rate of repeat revascularization and no
   difference in rates of all-cause death and MI. Clin. Cardiol. 2012 DOI:

   interest in women's football has been erratic, but North Korea
   prioritized women's football and provided it full support; that members
   of successful South Korean teams receive small financial rewards, while
   North Korean players receive decorations and significant material
   rewards, and that although South Korea established a systematic talent
   identification and training system in 2002, North Korea initiated this
   process more than a decade earlier.}},

Abstract = {{In response to the severe financial plight of many clubs that regularly
   take part in European competitions, UEFA developed the concept of
   Financial Fair Play as an extension of its licensing regulations. The
   aim of the concept is to curtail financial foul play in European
   football (nonpayment of liabilities owing to rival clubs or employees)
   and financial doping (excessive funding provided to cover losses arising
   from expenses for playing talent not balanced by revenues). The paper
   addresses the question if the Financial Fair Play is an adequate concept
   to ensure the long-term viability and sustainability of European club
   football as intended by UEFA. To answer this question, we illustrate the
   empirical background and search for a theoretical justification within
   the field of sport economics. Based on structuring UEFA's objectives, we
   analyze and evaluate the major amendments of the Financial Fair Play
   Regulations.}},

Abstract = {{Robbins, DW. The normalization of explosive functional movements in a
   diverse population of elite American football players. J Strength Cond
   Res 26(4): 995-1000, 2012-The objective of this study was to investigate
   the need to normalize, for body mass, explosive functional tasks in a
   population exhibiting diverse body masses. Measures investigated in
   elite college American football players attending the National Football
   League's annual combine (n = 1,136) were the 9.1-, 18.3-, and 36.6-m
   sprints, vertical and horizontal jumps, 18.3-m shuttle, and 3-cone
   drill. To determine the relationship between body mass and performance
   outcomes, Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) were generated using
   log-transformed data. Task-specific allometric exponents, accounting for
   body mass, were also determined. The strength of the correlations
   suggests that sprint and jump abilities are associated with body mass,
   whereas change-of-direction ability is not. The determined allometric
   exponents range between 0.296 and -0.463 for the sprint and jump tasks
   and are -0.022 and -0.006 for the 18.3-m shuttle and the 3-cone drill,
   respectively. In populations exhibiting relatively large variations in
   body mass, normalization of sprint and jump abilities is recommended,
   whereas normalization of change-of-direction ability is unwarranted.
   Novel suggestions derived from the present research are that sprint and
   jump abilities in diverse populations warrant normalization and that
   physical attributes associated with explosive functional movements
   deserve attribute-specific consideration when contemplating
   normalization.}},

Abstract = {{The sports industry is one of the world's fastest-growing business
   sectors, and its primary source of revenue is ultimately derived from
   sports fans. However, little is known about fans' allocations of time,
   effort, and financial expenditures to the sports they care most about or
   how they determine their allocations. The objective of our research is
   to explore the dimensions of sports consumption and fan avidity, and the
   nature of heterogeneity of such demand aspects vis-a-vis derived market
   segments. We develop a new constrained latent-structure multidimensional
   scaling procedure to uncover the underlying dimensions of sports
   consumption and fan avidity for student college football fans at a large
   university, and simultaneously derive latent market segments to explore
   demand heterogeneity. We collected data from a sample of student
   football fans from a large US public university known for its excellence
   in college football. We developed 35 expressions of manifestations of
   fan avidity and investigated how these college fans follow and support
   their football team. We then extracted four interpretable dimensions and
   four market segments with the application of this new spatial
   multidimensional scaling model. This paper discusses the managerial
   implications of applying this new latent-structure procedure to this
   college football context.}},

Abstract = {{This article approaches sports team supporters from two lenses: (1) that
   of branding, which defines supporters as loyal customers and potential
   commodities; (2) that of fandom, which understands supporters as
   agentive meaning-producers who use fandom for their own uses. This
   juxtaposition reveals how fans' sense of symbolic ownership is both
   impelled and disavowed. I use the term `brandom' to refer to
   brand-controlled `fan' communities that lack real autonomy. The case
   study of the Lazio Irriducibili `ultras' fan club in Rome Italy,
   demonstrates the potential of organized fans to create and promote
   branded commodities and, furthermore, it shows the potential of
   organized fans to threaten the symbolic and financial legitimacy of
   sports team/brand ownership, and the typical relationship that exists
   between fans (consumers) and teams (brands).}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the determinants of self-reported measures of
   national pride. Using pooled cross-sectional data for European countries
   obtained from the Eurobarometer, it is estimated that pride is not
   correlated with GDP per capita nor with household income levels. Using
   the 2000 UEFA European Championship as a natural experiment, it is
   estimated that individuals from both host and winning nations report, on
   average, higher levels of national pride in the period immediately
   following the event, supporting theoretical arguments of a
   ``feel-good{''} factor associated with sports events. Accounting for
   performance relative to expectations produces results along the same

Abstract = {{We examined the profitability of Division I athletic programs at
   colleges and universities in the United States under a variety of
   accounting definitions of profit. The data identified several broad
   themes. First, a majority of athletic departments relied heavily on
   direct and indirect subsidization of their programs by the student body,
   the institution itself, and state governments in order to balance their
   books. Without such funding, less than one-third of Bowl Championship
   Series (BCS) athletic departments and none of the non-BCS departments
   were in the black. Second, athletic programs relied heavily on
   contributions to balance their books. Donations to athletic departments
   may serve as a substitute for donations to the rest of the university,
   lowering giving to other programs. Third, football and men's basketball
   programs were generally highly profitable at BCS schools; however, below
   this top tier, fewer than 10\% of football programs and 15\% of men's
   basketball programs showed a profit by any reasonable accounting
   measures.}},

Abstract = {{The newly emergent Pasifika diasporas as elements of a new sports labour
   migrant are an important force of immense significance in global rugby
   football. This paper illustrates the place of rugby in Pasifika
   communities and how and why it has become a zone of potential success,
   aspiration and social advancement for Pasifika people. An impression is
   given of the enormity of their range and influence in the sport using
   illustrations drawn from the ranks of current Pacific professional rugby
   players. The complex relationship among Pacific Islanders, globalisation
   and rugby football will also be discussed demonstrating not merely the
   issue of Pasifika communities as recipients of the cultural effects of
   globalisation via imperial rule and cultural diffusion, but also of
   their impact as creolising agents on the sport of rugby throughout the
   mid twentieth century to the current professional era. Throughout this
   discussion it is noted that rugby is seen as a means not just of
   individual advancement but as a potential source of financial security
   for players' families and their wider communities in the Pacific Islands
   and in their adopted countries. The vexatious issue of remittances,
   responsibility and rugby as a major career pathway is also raised.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate Project Ithuseng, a life skills
   programme for professional soccer players in South Africa (SA). Prior to
   implementation, a needs assessment questionnaire was administered to all
   players, and seven focus groups were conducted with players. A life
   skills questionnaire was administered to all players pre- and
   post-implementation (n=123). Post-implementation, seven focus groups and
   nine key informant interviews were conducted. Priority issues identified
   in the formative evaluation were planning for the future, leadership,
   communication, teamwork, self-confidence, taking responsibility and
   financial skills. Post-implementation focus groups revealed that Project
   Ithuseng was generally perceived as beneficial for players. The main
   factor influencing successful implementation was the support of team
   management. There was a significant difference between pre- and
   post-implementation scores on the life skills questionnaire (p=0.046).
   Through encouraging collaboration between soccer stakeholders in SA,
   Project Ithuseng has created a platform for future work in this area.}},

Abstract = {{The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most common
   injuries in sports. ACL injuries are not only costly from financial and
   health services consumption standpoints, but also can have devastating
   consequences on patients' activity levels and quality of life.
   Tremendous efforts have been made over the past two decades toward the
   goal of preventing ACL injuries. A substantial number of studies have
   been performed to determine the characteristics of ACL injury events,
   identify risk factors for ACL injury, and develop prevention strategies.
   The purpose of this review was to objectively summarize the current
   literature regarding the characteristics of ACL injury, ACL loading
   mechanisms, and risk factors for injury to provide a comprehensive
   understanding of the current state of research and how our current level
   of knowledge may inform clinical practice in this area.}},

Abstract = {{Professional football in Europe is characterized by persistent deficits
   and growing debts among the majority of the top league clubs. Despite
   these problems, the clubs have an abnormally high survival rate. This
   paper focuses on this apparent paradox and poses the question: Why do
   only very few European professional football clubs go out of business
   even though they operate chronically on the edge of financial collapse?
   The paper argues that the paradox can be explained by the fact that
   professional football clubs operate within soft budget constraints in a
   way which is similar to the role of large companies in socialist
   economies - a phenomenon which was first identified by the Hungarian
   Economist Janos Kornai.}},

Abstract = {{In accordance with its slogan `The Future is Asia', the Asian Football
   Confederation initiated the Vision Asia football development programme
   in 2003. Focusing on marketing, grass roots, coach education, referees,
   sports medicine, men's competitions, women's competitions, futsal,
   media, and fans, it is claimed to be a comprehensive complement to
   FIFA's Goal Project. Furthermore the AFC has introduced a financial aid
   programme called AID27 and its social responsibility campaign titled
   Dream Asia focusing on utilising football as vehicle for achieving
   development, peace and social justice. Aimed at exploring the role of
   the football governing body AFC in the transnational governance and
   development of football in Asia in the context of a globalised game,
   this article provides an overview of the history of the AFC and its
   political relations with FIFA and Asian member associations. In addition
   it contains an analysis of the AFC's institutional structure, its
   policies and network relations. Accordingly the article implies a
   description of how specifically the AID27 and Vision Asia programmes are
   aimed at developing and increasing the standards of Asian football.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients
   who sustain tibia fractures during athletic competition are at an
   increased risk of developing acute compartment syndrome (ACS).
   Design: Retrospective review.
   Setting: University Level I trauma center.
   Participants/Patients: Acute tibia fractures in 626 patients between
   July 2006 and June 2009.
   Methods: A retrospective review of 626 consecutive tibia fractures
   treated by our department between July 2006 and June 2009 was performed.
   We recorded the mechanism and type of fracture as well as whether or not
   ACS developed. Soccer and football injuries were analyzed as specific
   groups. Chi square was used to analyze our results.
   Main Outcome Measurements: The rate of ACS in patients injured during
   sporting events versus that of all patients with a tibia fracture.
   Results: Thirty-four patients (5.4\%) developed ACS, which is consistent
   with the published literature. Nine patients sustained the injury while
   playing soccer (1.4\% of patients), whereas 11 patients (1.7\%) were
   injured playing football. Five of the nine soccer players (55\%; P <
   0.001) and three of the football players (27\%; P < 0.001) developed
   ACS. Collectively, tibia fractures sustained in football and soccer led
   to 25\% of ACS cases despite accounting for only 3.1\% of all tibia
   fractures.
   Conclusions: Tibia fractures sustained during soccer and football had a
   statistically significant association with development of ACS in our
   patient population during this time period. Such patients should be
   monitored closely and followed with high clinical suspicion for ACS.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to measure the
   efficiency of Portuguese football clubs in the First League for seasons
   2002/03 to 2008/09. Clubs spend different amounts of money on their
   players and use different incentive devices to achieve their aims for
   each season. Our first aim is to find out whether clubs are spending
   more money than they need to. Evidence shows that this is the case for
   several clubs, suggesting that buying players solely with a view to
   selling them on for future financial gain can seriously damage clubs'
   accounts and efficiency. This is all the more remarkable as the
   competitive level is increasing and Union of European Football
   Associations (UEFA) is issuing more stringent financial stability
   conditions. Our second aim is to ascertain the relationship between the
   players' wage distribution and the clubs' efficiency. We demonstrate
   that a higher wage spread tends to be associated with an increase in
   efficiency. The implication is that clubs should structure wages so as
   to have the optimal pay ranking for inducing players' effort.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence of focal articular cartilage lesions among athletes is
   higher than in the general population. Treatment goals differ
   considerably between the professional and recreational athlete. High

   influence the treatment selection for the professional athlete, while
   such parameters weigh differently in recreational sports. This article
   describes our investigation of the relation between sports and a high

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of playing tactics,
   opponent interaction and situational variables on achieving score-box
   possessions in professional soccer. The sample was constituted by 908
   possessions obtained by a team from the Spanish soccer league in 12
   matches played during the 2009-2010 season. Multidimensional qualitative
   data obtained from 12 ordered categorical variables were used. Sampled
   matches were registered by the AMISCO PRO (R) system. Data were analysed
   using chi-square analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis. Of
   908 possessions, 303 (33.4\%) produced score-box possessions, 477
   (52.5\%) achieved progression and 128 (14.1\%) failed to reach any sort
   of progression. Multiple logistic regression showed that, for the main
   variable ``team possession type{''}, direct attacks and counterattacks
   were three times more effective than elaborate attacks for producing a
   score-box possession (P < 0.05). Team possession originating from the
   middle zones and playing against less than six defending players (P <
   0.001) registered a higher success than those started in the defensive
   zone with a balanced defence. When the team was drawing or winning, the
   probability of reaching the score-box decreased by 43 and 53 percent,
   respectively, compared with the losing situation (P < 0.05). Accounting
   for opponent interactions and situational variables is critical to
   evaluate the effectiveness of offensive playing tactics on producing
   score-box possessions.}},

Title = {{A one-year monitoring of nicotine use in sport: Frontier between
   potential performance enhancement and addiction issues}},
Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL}},

Abstract = {{Tobacco consumption is a global epidemic responsible for a vast burden
   of disease. With pharmacological properties sought-after by consumers
   and responsible for addiction issues, nicotine is the main reason of
   this phenomenon. Accordingly, smokeless tobacco products are of growing
   popularity in sport owing to potential performance enhancing properties
   and absence of adverse effects on the respiratory system. Nevertheless,
   nicotine does not appear on the 2011 World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)
   Prohibited List or Monitoring Program by lack of a comprehensive
   large-scale prevalence survey. Thus, this work describes a one-year
   monitoring study on urine specimens from professional athletes of
   different disciplines covering 2010 and 2011. A method for the detection
   and quantification of nicotine, its major metabolites (cotinine,
   trans-3-hydroxycotinine, nicotine-N'-oxide and cotinine-N-oxide) and
   minor tobacco alkaloids (anabasine, anatabine and nornicotine) was
   developed, relying on ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled
   to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-TQ-MS/MS). A simple and
   fast dilute-and-shoot sample treatment was performed, followed by
   hydrophilic interaction chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
   (HILIC-MS/MS) operated in positive electrospray ionization (ESI) mode
   with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) data acquisition. After method
   validation, assessing the prevalence of nicotine consumption in sport
   involved analysis of 2185 urine samples, accounting for 43 different
   sports. Concentrations distribution of major nicotine metabolites, minor
   nicotine metabolites and tobacco alkaloids ranged from 10 (LLOQ) to
   32,223, 6670 and 538 ng/mL, respectively. Compounds of interest were
   detected in trace levels in 23.0\% of urine specimens, with
   concentration levels corresponding to an exposure within the last three
   days for 18.3\% of samples. Likewise, hypothesizing conservative
   concentration limits for active nicotine consumption prior and/or during
   sport practice (50 ng/mL for nicotine, cotinine and
   trans-3-hydroxycotinine and 25 ng/mL for nicotine-N'-oxide,
   cotinine-N-oxide, anabasine, anatabine and nornicotine) revealed a
   prevalence of 15.3\% amongst athletes. While this number may appear
   lower than the worldwide smoking prevalence of around 25\%, focusing the
   study on selected sports highlighted more alarming findings. Indeed,
   active nicotine consumption in ice hockey, skiing, biathlon, bobsleigh,
   skating, football, basketball, volleyball, rugby, American football,
   wrestling and gymnastics was found to range between 19.0 and 55.6\%.
   Therefore, considering the adverse effects of smoking on the respiratory
   tract and numerous health threats detrimental to sport practice at top
   level, likelihood of smokeless tobacco consumption for performance
   enhancement is greatly supported. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex and debilitating neurological
   injury that places a significant financial and emotional burden on both
   families and medical providers. Accumulating evidence suggests that mild
   TBI or concussion remains grossly underdiagnosed, as compared with more
   severe TBI, due to a poor understanding of the clinical signs and
   symptoms involved with a head injury. Notably, pediatric head injury may
   be associated with the subsequent development of serious, long-term
   neurological consequences, emphasizing the need for improved diagnosis
   and acute medical intervention. The purpose of this minireview is to
   summarize the association between participation in youth athletics and
   the occurrence of concussions, a primary source of mild TBI in the
   adolescent population, with the goal of increasing awareness within the
   nursing profession for this clinically important yet underdiagnosed form
   of brain injury.}},

Abstract = {{Variations in rates of growth and development in young football players
   can influence relationships among various fitness qualities. Purpose: To
   investigate the relationships between repeated-sprint ability and other
   fundamental fitness qualities of acceleration, agility, explosive leg
   power, and aerobic conditioning through the age groups of U11 to U18 in
   highly trained junior football players. Methods: Male players (n = 119)
   across the age groups completed a fitness assessment battery over two
   testing sessions. The first session consisted of countermovement jumps
   without and with arm swing, 15-m sprint run, 15-m agility run, and the
   20-m Shuttle Run (U11 to U15) or the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test,
   Level 1 (U16 to U18). The players were tested for repeated-sprint
   ability in the second testing session using a protocol of 6 x 30-m
   sprints on 30 s with an active recovery. Results: The correlations of
   repeated-sprint ability with the assorted fitness tests varied
   considerably between the age groups, especially for agility (r = .02 to
   .92) and explosive leg power (r = .04 to .84). Correlations of repeated
   sprint ability with acceleration (r = .48 to .93) and aerobic
   conditioning (r = .28 to .68) were less variable with age. Conclusion:
   Repeated-sprint ability associates differently with other fundamental
   fitness tests throughout the teenage years in highly trained football
   players, although stabilization of these relationships occurs by the age
   of 18 y. Coaches in junior football should prescribe physical training
   accounting for variations in short-term disruptions or impairment of
   physical performance during this developmental period.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction The incidence of traumatic spinal cord injury varies in
   different countries from 2.5 to 57.8 per million per annum, with sport
   accounting for 8-12.7\% of these injuries. Spinal injuries associated
   with recreational sport often result in long-term permanent disability
   in otherwise active individuals.
   Materials and methods The aetiology, pattern and mechanism of the 196
   sports-related spinal injuries treated in the National Spinal Injuries
   unit in Ireland from 1993 to 2003 is reviewed in this article.
   Results Sports-related spinal injuries accounted for 11\% of all spinal
   injury admissions. There were 145 (74\%) males and 51 (26\%) females,
   with an average age of 30.2 years (range 14-72 years). The most common
   sport responsible for a spinal injury was equestrian events (41.8\%),
   rugby (16.3\%), diving (15.3\%), Gaelic football and hurling (9.6\%),
   cycling (4.2\%), and miscellaneous (12.7\%). Injury distribution was
   cervical spine (118 patients, 60\%), thoracic (41 patients, 21\%),
   lumbar spine (37 patients, 19\%). In 18 patients (9.25\%) more than one
   region was affected. In 78 patients (40\%) more than one vertebral level
   was affected. On admission 71 patients (36\%) had a neurological deficit
   with 46 patients (65\%) incomplete and 25 (35\%) complete, of which 6
   patients (23\%) were paraplegic and 19 (77\%) were tetraplegic.
   Conclusion Sport is an important cause of spinal injury among young
   people in Ireland. This study contributes to our understanding of these
   injuries aetiology, pattern and mechanism of injury and allows
   constructive recommendations for injury prevention and management.}},

Abstract = {{Betting markets have drawn much attention in the economics, finance and
   operational research literature because they provide a valuable window
   on the manner in which individuals use information in wider financial
   markets. One question that has received particular attention is to what
   extent individuals discount information in market prices. The
   predominant approach to explore this issue involves predictive modeling
   to forecast market outcomes and examining empirically whether abnormal
   returns can be made by employing these forecasts. It is argued here that
   present practices to assess such forecasting models, including the use
   of point estimates and information, which would not be available in
   practice (at the forecasting stage) and failing to update forecasting
   models with information from the recent past, may give rise to
   misleading conclusions regarding a market's informational efficiency.
   Hypotheses are developed to conceptualize these views and are tested by
   means of extensive empirical experimentation using real-world data from
   the Hong Kong horserace betting market. Our study identifies several
   sources of bias and confirms that current practices may not be relied
   upon. A more appropriate modeling procedure for assessing the true
   degree of market efficiency is then proposed. Journal of the Operational

Abstract = {{After the lockout season in 2004, the 2005 collective bargaining
   agreement (CBA) introduced salary regulations, as well as revenue

   question arises if efficiencies improved under the new CBA. Using team
   values as the dependent variable, we performed a stochastic frontier
   analysis. Our paper suggests that efficiencies immediately improved
   after the agreement, in particular for low performing teams.}},

Abstract = {{Athletic department websites have become a centerpiece of institutional
   athletic marketing efforts. Every Division I NCAA athletic department
   currently has a website, and these websites have become a significant
   element in communication brand-building efforts (NCAA Members, 2006). A
   primary benefit of athletic department websites is the ability to
   promote their overall product through the provision of equitable
   coverage to each of the teams housed within their department through
   individual team pages. The purpose of this study was to identify the
   advertisement and multimedia coverage of individual teams on NCAA
   Division I intercollegiate athletic home websites and contrast the
   coverage with participation rates and team gross revenue. Twenty
   Division I (10 programs {[}FBS]; 10 programs {[}FCS]) athletic websites
   were selected based on sport offerings, and data were gathered during
   three weeks of each of the three sport seasons (Fall, Winter, and
   Spring) featured during the academic school year (N = 420). Overall,
   from an equity perspective, the results demonstrated that men's and
   women's basketball, and football received significantly more multimedia
   and promotional coverage when in comparison to the teams that received
   negative coverage differences. In contrast, when analyzing the coverage
   from a financial standpoint, the results confirmed that football was
   underrepresented. (C) 2011 Sport Management Association of Australia and

   subsequently, there is no evidence that the products were substitutes

Abstract = {{Background: Ankle injuries are the most common injury in basketball
   players. However, no prospective studies have been performed to
   determine if wearing lace-up ankle braces will reduce the incidence of
   ankle injuries in high school athletes.
   Purpose: This trial was undertaken to determine if lace-up ankle braces
   reduce the incidence and severity of acute first-time and recurrent
   ankle injuries sustained by high school basketball players.
   Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.
   Methods: A total of 1460 male and female basketball players from 46 high
   schools were randomly assigned to a braced or control group. The braced
   group players wore lace-up ankle braces during the 2009-2010 basketball
   season. Athletic trainers recorded brace compliance, athlete exposures,
   and injuries. Cox proportional hazards models (adjusted for demographic
   covariates), accounting for intracluster correlation, were utilized to
   compare time to first acute ankle injury between groups. Injury severity
   (days lost) was tested with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
   Results: The rate of acute ankle injury (per 1000 exposures) was 0.47 in
   the braced group and 1.41 in the control group (Cox hazard ratio {[}HR]
   0.32; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.20, 0.52; P < .001). The median
   severity of acute ankle injuries was similar (P = .23) in the braced (6
   days) and control group (7 days). For players with a previous ankle
   injury, the incidence of acute ankle injury was 0.83 in the braced group
   and 1.79 in the control group (Cox HR 0.39; 95\% CI 0.17, 0.90; P =
   .028). For players who did not report a previous ankle injury, the
   incidence of acute ankle injury was 0.40 in the braced group and 1.35 in
   the control group (Cox HR 0.30; 95\% CI 0.17, 0.52, P < .001).
   Conclusion: Use of lace-up ankle braces reduced the incidence but not
   the severity of acute ankle injuries in male and female high school
   basketball athletes both with and without a previous history of an ankle
   injury.}},

Abstract = {{In many countries, betting in sports is highly regulated but both in the
   U.S. and in Europe there are current debates whether regulation should
   be loosened. We empirically investigate core arguments of these debates
   with a special focus on Germany. A crucial part of the argument in
   German Law is that sport bets could be qualified as `games of skill'
   that are considered to be less dangerous than `games of chance,' and are
   thus assumed to need less regulation. We explore this hypothesis in
   three incentivized online studies on soccer betting (N = 214) and
   provide evidence against two crucial parts of this argument. First, we
   show that there are no overall effects of skill on accuracy in soccer
   bets and monetary earnings do not increase with skill. Hence, soccer
   betting cannot be considered a game of skill. Second, we show that
   soccer betting induces strong overconfidence and illusion of control,
   particularly for people who assume they have high skill, and that these
   biases lead to increased betting. Cognitive biases that might cause
   financial harm for bettors or even lead to problematic or pathological
   gambling behavior are even stronger for soccer bets compared to bets on
   the outcome of lotteries. Concerning the main aims of legal regulation
   for gambling in German law, our results strongly speak for regulation of
   soccer bets. We discuss that similar arguments can be made under U.S.
   law.}},

Abstract = {{The recent transfers of Christian Ronaldo from Manchester United, and of
   Ricardo lzecson dos Santos Leite (Kaka) from Associazione Calcio Milan
   to Real Madrid as well as the increasing financial problems of many of
   the top teams in the big five European leagues have again increased the
   public's attention for the global football players' labor market.
   Therefore, the paper addresses two important, and highly contested,
   issues: player remuneration and contract duration (players are usually
   considered as overpaid and poorly motivated. Using two different
   unbalanced panels from the German Bundesliga league that cover six and
   13 consecutive seasons respectively (1997-98 to 2002-03 and 1995-96 to
   2007-08), I show, first, that the variance in player salaries can be
   explained, to a large extent, by the variance in individual performance.
   That is, salaries can be explained by career games played and games
   played last season, previous and recent international appearances, and
   goals scored. Moreover, player position, leadership skills, and region
   of birth clearly matter as well. The impact of these characteristics
   varies across the salary distribution. Second, I find robust evidence
   that player performance-measured primarily, but not exclusively, by a
   subjective overall player rating from Kicker, a highly respected soccer
   magazine-significantly increases in the last year of the contract. In
   addition, the variance in player performance is significantly lower in
   the last year of the contract. These findings suggest that moral hazard
   is a widespread phenomenon, even in professional soccer.}},

Abstract = {{Research examining the factors influencing selection within talented
   junior Rugby League players is limited. The aims of this study were
   firstly to determine whether differences existed for anthropometric and
   performance characteristics between regional and national selection in
   high performance UK junior Rugby League players, and secondly to
   identify variables that discriminated between these selection levels.
   Regional representative (n=1172) selected junior players (aged 13-16
   years) undertook an anthropometric and fitness testing battery with
   players split according to selection level (i.e., national, regional).
   MANCOVA analyses, with age and maturation controlled, identified
   national players as having lower sum of 4 skinfolds scores compared to
   regional players, and also performed significantly better on all
   physical tests. Stepwise discriminant analysis identified that estimated
   maximum oxygen uptake ((V) over dotO(2max)), chronological age, body
   mass, 20m sprint, height, sum of 4 skinfolds and sitting height
   discriminated between selection levels, accounting for 28.7\% of the
   variance. This discriminant analysis corresponded to an overall
   predictive accuracy of 63.3\% for all players. These results indicate
   that performance characteristics differed between selection levels in
   junior Rugby League players. However, the small magnitude of difference
   between selection levels suggests that physical qualities only partially
   explain higher representative selection. The monitoring and evaluation
   of such variables, alongside game related performance characteristics,
   provides greater knowledge and understanding about the processes and
   consequences of selection, training and performance in youth sport. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: Investigations into hamstring strain injuries at the elite
   level exist in sports such as Australian Rules football, rugby, and
   soccer, but no large-scale study exists on the incidence and
   circumstances surrounding these injuries in the National Football League
   (NFL).
   Hypothesis: Injury rates will vary between different player positions,
   times in the season, and across different playing situations.
   Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study.
   Methods: Between 1989 and 1998, injury data were prospectively collected
   by athletic trainers for every NFL team and recorded in the NFL's Injury
   Surveillance System. Data collected included team, date of injury,
   activity the player was engaged in at the time of injury, injury
   severity, position played, mechanism of injury, and history of previous
   injury. Injury rates were reported in injuries per athlete-exposure
   (A-E). An athlete-exposure was defined as 1 athlete participating in
   either 1 practice or 1 game.
   Results: Over the 10-year study period 1716 hamstring strains were
   reported for an injury rate (IR) of 0.77 per 1000 A-E. More than half
   (51.3\%) of hamstring strains occurred during the 7-week preseason. The
   preseason practice IR was significantly elevated compared with the
   regular-season practice IR (0.82/1000 A-E and 0.18/1000 A-E,
   respectively). The most commonly injured positions were the defensive
   secondary, accounting for 23.1\% of the injuries; the wide receivers,
   accounting for 20.8\%; and special teams, constituting 13.0\% of the
   injuries in the study.
   Conclusion: Hamstring strains are a considerable cause of disability in
   football, with the majority of injuries occurring during the short
   preseason. In particular, the speed position players, such as the wide
   receivers and defensive secondary, as well as players on the special
   teams units, are at elevated risk for injury. These positions and
   situations with a higher risk of injury provide foci for preventative
   interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Past research indicates that top college football players generate over
   \$500,000 annually in team revenues, well beyond the effective
   compensation of an athletic scholarship. This article supplements past
   empirical literature using the most comprehensive, detailed financial
   information yet compiled on college athletics. An alternative method
   estimates an equations system to account for the endogeneity of both a
   team's premium players and its overall performance. Estimates show that
   the marginal revenue product of a premium college football player-one
   drafted into the National Football League (NFL)-exceeds \$1 million in
   2004-2005 football revenues, over 30\% higher than in previous estimates
   from 1988-1989 revenues.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary professional football in the Netherlands has a close
   relationship with business and finance. This relationship is often one
   that is concerning to supporters of clubs who feel that they are being
   treated more as consumers than loyal followers of their team. This paper
   will represent the historic situation in Dutch football between 1910 and
   1920. Particular focus will be placed on the role of advertising in the
   media and the illustration it gives of businesses interaction with the
   cultural field of football at this time. This paper will also give an
   overview of how businesses and individuals in the business field
   sometimes interacted with clubs and wider football projects. The paper
   suggests that the idea of football supporters as consumers is perhaps
   not as new as is often thought.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyzes the effects of initial public offerings (IPO) on the
   performance of European football clubs. We use a unique panel dataset
   consisting of domestic and international performance data to investigate
   a football club's on-field performance before and after going public.
   The study finds that the performance of football clubs does not improve
   on average with or after an IPO. Only football clubs in lower divisions
   benefit from a stock market listing. At the international level, there
   is no evidence of an improved performance associated with the IPO. The
   findings are consistent with shareholder ownership imposing tacit
   restrictions towards excessive debt and investments.}},

Title = {{The Paucity of, and Dilemma in, Evaluating Corporate Social
   Responsibility for Development through Sport}},
Journal = {{THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{551-569}},
Abstract = {{Corporate social responsibility (csr) and sportoften in combination with
   each otherare being increasingly voiced as vehicles that assist various
   forms of social and economic development, particularly in years with
   mega-sporting events like the 2010 football World Cup. However, there is
   little evidence of evaluation to demonstrate that csr-for-development or
   sport-for-development works (especially over time). This article
   examines the extent to which evaluation of csr for development through
   sport has been undertaken, with specific reference to the 2010 World
   Cupan event portrayed as displaying developmental virtues. The research
   highlights not only a paucity of evaluation for csr for development in
   general and csr for development through sport in particular (as
   discussion on evaluation largely revolves around financial performance,
   often from the perspective of the corporation) but also a dilemma: when
   prevailing techniques of evaluation of mainstream development are
   conducted, a concern is raised that the techniques implemented are
   overly managerial or one-dimensional, representing a crass tick-box
   mentality that fails to address the contextual environment in which
   development is delivered and steeped in unequal power relations. As a
   result, the critical development perspective can point to a further
   element that highlights the paucity and inherent problems of csr for
   development.}},

Title = {{War Minus the Shooting? The politics of sport in Lebanon as a unique
   case in comparative politics}},
Journal = {{THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{261-277}},
Abstract = {{In the literature on sport and politics the potential of sport to unite
   fragmented societies is emphasised. Lebanon is a counter example. Sport
   does not unite but further divides people. Confessionalism, the
   political system of this `mosaic state' with 18 state-registered sects,
   produces conditions that only allow for competition within sects. The
   sport sector, especially the professional men's teams in football and
   basketball, serves as a tool for competition within and between sects.
   In a middle-income country with only four million inhabitants, club
   revenues from ticketing and broadcasting are almost non-existent.
   Therefore professional sport teams are completely dependent on sponsors.
   Within a patron-client relationship system, political leaders finance
   the clubs but expect complete loyalty from the teams, implemented
   through such practices as choosing their party colours as team colours
   or posting large pictures of themselves in the arenas. While national
   sports teams often have the potential to unite societies, in Lebanon
   this can only happen if first steps from a sectarian to a secular state
   are taken. Then a common national identity (including general support
   for the national sports teams) might gradually develop and later
   transform the confessional subsystems such as the media, schools and
   sports clubs towards non-sectarian entities.}},

Abstract = {{The scope of this paper is to analyze the impact of corporate governance
   quality (namely board size, board independence, managerial ownership,
   institutional ownership and CEO duality) on the earnings management
   behaviour of European Union's football clubs over the period 2006-2009.
   Empirical results documented that corporate governance quality mitigates
   aggressive earnings manipulation (income smoothing, accrual manipulation
   and reporting small positive income) by football managers and
   specifically clubs with increased board independence, managerial
   ownership and institutional ownership and small board size are
   associated with high quality financial reporting through the
   deterioration of earnings management behaviour. These findings dictate
   the necessity of sound corporate governance principles to protect the
   interests of shareholders and various stakeholders, and prevent the
   expropriation of wealth by managers and maximize the clubs' economic
   results and social return. The empirical findings are robust to several
   sensitivity tests concerning the functioning form of the models and the
   measures of earnings management.}},

Title = {{The influence of sport leagues on the business-to-business marketing of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BUSINESS \& INDUSTRIAL MARKETING}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This study seeks to examine how a sport league, a unique
   feature of professional sport, influences the business-to-business
   marketing of teams participating in the sport league.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a qualitative research
   design based on a single case study, the UCI Pro Tour in professional
   road cycling. The primary sources consist of 27 semi-structured
   interviews complemented by written sources and controlled for construct
   validity, external validity and reliability.
   Findings - From a theoretical point of view, a sport league is a
   marketing channel network (a specific type of an intentionally developed
   business network or IDBN). Theoretical analysis also reveals that the
   teams' business-to-business marketing is positively related to the
   network's value-creating system. Empirically, it is argued that the
   introduction of a marketing channel network has a positive influence on
   the financial value of the teams' business-to-business market but does
   not result in a change in the business demographics of corporate
   sponsors.
   Research limitations - The study has possible sport-specific
   limitations.
   Practical implications - Business-to-business marketers and sport league
   managers should pay attention to the characteristics of the sport league
   as these influence the teams' business-to-business market. This is
   especially valid for sports in which teams rely strongly on sport
   sponsoring and, to a lesser extend, on gate revenues, television rights
   and prize money.
   Originality/value - For the first time, this study examines and provides
   data on the business-to-business environment of teams in professional
   road cycling. It contributes to the literature of international sport
   marketing and professional road cycling, a sport gaining momentum in
   various countries and which is understudied in comparison to other
   sports.}},

Abstract = {{State supported universities have been investing considerable sums in
   intercollegiate athletics in the hope that such investments will pay off
   in terms of increased enrollments, improved student quality, and
   economic benefits such as revenues from ticket sales and bowl and
   tournament appearances Does athletic success also yield returns in the
   form of greater state appropriations? This paper finds that there is
   some evidence to support this contention though the impact on state
   appropriations appears to be concentrated more heavily on the members of
   Division I-A with winning football or basketball programs There appears
   to be little impact for schools that are members of Divisions I-AA, II,
   or III or on DI-A schools that fail to attain on-field success It also
   appears that conference affiliation has little impact on appropriations
   as well These findings call into question the benefit of continued
   investment in intercollegiate athletics by schools in these divisions or
   by schools with little chance of athletic success at the Division I-A
   level}},

   However, failures can be extremely complicated and multifaceted, defying
   clear cause attribution. Learning organizations face challenges in
   adopting and implementing the lessons of such failures and many times
   are unable to appropriately correct the root causes. Using a grounded
   theory approach, the authors present a learning case by Major League
   Soccer (MLS) from its failed predecessor-the North American Soccer
   League (NASL), depicting patterns of learning in four aspects: control,
   foreign players, media relationships, and financial viability. The
   authors propose a two-stage process model of vicarious learning from
   failure based on two fundamental processes: cause attribution and lesson
   implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe the epidemiology of fractures among US high
   school athletes participating in 9 popular sports.
   Design: Descriptive epidemiologic study.
   Setting: Sports injury data for the 2005-2009 academic years were
   collected using an Internet-based injury surveillance system, Reporting
   Information Online (RIO).
   Participants: A nationally representative sample of 100 US high schools.
   Assessment of Risk Factors: Injuries sustained as a function of sport
   and sex.
   Main Outcome Measures: Fracture injury rates, body site, outcome,
   surgery, and mechanism.
   Results: Fractures (n = 568 177 nationally) accounted for 10.1\% of all
   injuries sustained by US high school athletes. The highest rate of
   fractures was in football (4.61 per 10 000 athlete exposures) and the
   lowest in volleyball (0.52). Boys were more likely than girls to sustain
   a fracture in basketball (rate ratio, 1.35,; 95\% confidence interval,
   1.06-1.72) and soccer (rate ratio, 1.34; 95\% confidence interval,
   1.05-1.71). Overall, the most frequently fractured body sites were the
   hand/finger (28.3\%), wrist (10.4\%), and lower leg (9.3\%). Fractures
   were the most common injury to the nose (76.9\%), forearm (56.4\%),
   hand/finger (41.7\%), and wrist (41.6\%). Most fractures resulted in > 3
   weeks' time lost (34.3\%) or a medical disqualification from
   participation (24.2\%) and were more likely to result in > 3 weeks' time
   lost and medical disqualification than all other injuries combined.
   Fractures frequently required expensive medical diagnostic imaging
   examinations such as x-ray, computed tomographic scan, and magnetic
   resonance imaging. Additionally, 16.1\% of fractures required surgical
   treatment, accounting for 26.9\% of all injuries requiring surgery.
   Illegal activity was noted in 9.3\% of all fractures with the highest
   proportion of fractures related to illegal activity in girls' soccer
   (27.9\%).
   Conclusions: Fractures are a major concern for US high school athletes.
   They can severely affect the athlete's ability to continue sports
   participation and can impose substantial medical costs on the injured
   athletes' families. Targeted, evidence-based, effective fracture
   prevention programs are needed.}},

   clubs compete, this paper presents a comparative institutional analysis
   of three paradigmatic structures of football club governance: privately
   owned football firms, public football corporations (stock corporations
   with dispersed ownership) and members' associations with an own legal
   personality (Verein). Against the background that ``spending power{''}
   is the main driver of competitive advantage for clubs in the
   overinvestment environment of European football, the governance
   structure of the privately owned football firm exhibits superior
   abilities to tap sources of funding and channel them into playing
   talent. The results of the analysis are applied to current developments
   in German and English football and to recent initiatives of the Football
   Governing Bodies.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives and design. To address an apparent increase in the number of
   rugby-related spinal cord injuries (SCIs) in South Africa, a
   retrospective case-series study was conducted on injuries that occurred
   between 1980 and 2007. We aimed to identify preventable causes to reduce
   the overall rate of SCIs in South African rugby.
   Methods. We identified 264 rugby-related SCIs. A structured
   questionnaire was used, and it was possible to obtain information on a
   total of 183 players, including 30 who had died.
   Results. SCIs increased in number in the 1980s and in 2006. Forwards
   sustained 76\% of all SCIs, and club players 60\%. Players aged 17 had
   the highest number of SCIs. In only 50\% of cases were medical personnel
   present at the time of injury, and 49\% of injured players waited longer
   than 6 hours for acute management. Of players with an SCI, 61\% had a
   catastrophic outcome after 12 months, including 8\% who died during that
   time; 65\% received no financial compensation; and only 29\% of players
   had medical aid or health insurance.
   Conclusion. A register of all rugby-related SCIs in South Africa is
   essential to monitor the magnitude of the problem, identify potential
   risk factors, and formulate appropriate preventive interventions. The
   lack of reliable denominator data limits calculation of incident rates.
   Players from previously disadvantaged communities in particular suffered
   the consequences of limited public health care resources and no
   financial compensation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper shows the current financial situation of Spanish professional
   football. Different financial ratios are used in order to classify the
   financial position of the different teams. The study has been split
   between clubs in First or Second division. We also analyze the
   relationships between the size of market, team payrolls, and team
   performance. We demonstrate the financial problems created by the arms
   race that clubs have started for getting the most talented players for
   trying to get the best possible sporting outcome. The new Spanish Law
   for companies in financial distress has implied that nine clubs are
   technically insolvent and under administration. We have searched for
   possible explanations of that situation. Nevertheless, our financial
   variables do not explain the likelihood that a club goes into

Abstract = {{People appear to be unrealistically optimistic about their future
   prospect, as reflected by theory and research in the fields of
   psychology, organizational behavior, behavioral economics, and
   behavioral finance Many real-world examples (e g, consumer behavior
   during economic recessions), however, suggest that people are not always
   overly optimistic 1 suggest that people can be both overly optimistic
   and pessimistic in their beliefs about future events, depending on
   whether they focus on success or on failure More specifically, people
   judge the likelihood of desirable and undesirable events to be higher
   than similar neutral events because they misattribute the arousal those
   events evoke to their greater perceived likelihood I demonstrated this
   stake-likelihood effect in 4 studies In Study 1, arousal was shown to
   increase likelihood judgments Study 2 demonstrated that such elevated
   likelihood judgments are due to misattribution of the arousal from
   having a stake in the outcome Study 3 demonstrated that such
   misattribution of arousal occurs for desirable and undesirable events
   Study 4 showed the effects of optimism and pessimism on likelihood
   judgments in a field setting with soccer fans Together, the findings
   suggest that wishful thinking might be less prevalent than previously
   believed Pessimism might be as likely as optimism in subjective
   probabilities}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to understand outdoor recreational
   behaviors and preferences of the residents in Istanbul. The findings of
   the study are based on a survey which was conducted among 1,400
   residents in 32 districts of Istanbul in 2006 and 2007. As the study
   revealed, about one third of the residents participate in recreational
   activities in their spare time in Istanbul. Having a picnic, walking,
   and playing soccer and basketball are the most important outdoor
   recreational activities while playing tennis, hunting, skating, water
   skiing, and climbing are the least important activities among the
   residents. The majority of the residents in Istanbul do not think that
   they engage in outdoor recreational activities enough due to some
   constraints like lack of time, financial problems, inadequacy of outdoor
   recreational areas, lack of companion, and health problems.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The paper aims to review the fundamental concept of quality
   function deployment (QFD) and discusses the fact that a road to success
   for a new product development is the identification of customers
   requirements and their conversion into engineering design requirements
   Thereafter it seeks to review the subject and to study four new cases on
   the topic of QFD
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper discusses key elements of QFD
   and the fact that the vision for the development of a comprehensive
   quality system can be built upon the principles of QFD taking customer
   requirements into consideration and relating that to the design
   requirements
   Findings - To make product development task successful and bringing
   competitive advantages to the core business management must be committed
   to the needs of the customers through marketing surveys and implementing
   that into the process of product development by converting them into
   engineering design requirements
   Practical implications - The method has been used successfully in
   practice in areas such as facility locations marketing strategies robot
   selection ERP selection software development and sports
   Originality/value - The paper reviews QFDs and its extensions such as
   fuzzy QFD analytic hierarchy process analytic network process and QFD
   statistically extended QFD dynamic QFD and other extensions of that In
   addition to that cases covering topics of ship of quality cost design
   parameter modeling enhanced version of the quality function development
   financial factors and uncertainties in the product design process with
   fuzzy formulation and a model for prioritizing and designing rule
   changes for the game of soccer are also reviewed}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study is to determine what factors affect the
   attractiveness of both national football leagues and the Champions
   League from the perspective of fans, and how these factors are perceived
   by fans of clubs at the top and bottom of the league standing. This is
   of interest as there are differences between the financial resources
   available to the clubs and leagues. Based on a review of sport consumer
   behaviour literature, we propose that four determinants are relevant to
   a league's attractiveness: stadium atmosphere, international success of
   the clubs, uniqueness of dominating clubs and perceived competitive
   balance. A total of 1,404 committed fans of 12 selected football teams
   from the English Premier League and German Bundesliga participated in
   the study. The research model was tested using partial least squares.
   The results show that the determinants significantly predict perceived
   attractiveness, and that even fans of financially privileged and
   successful clubs concede that perceived competitive balance is necessary
   for attractiveness to be maintained.}},

Abstract = {{Professional football clubs are service enterprises engaged in the
   business of performance, entertainment and financial profit. Developing
   young players may reap both sporting and financial rewards to clubs,
   players and football agents. This paper explores the organizational
   structure and working practices of professional football clubs
   concerning young player development. Semi-structured interviews were
   conducted with heads of youth development within elite clubs (n =26)
   across five European countries. The study reveals the presence of
   organizational homogenization within formal youth structures across
   Europe. Developing players for first team, player's personal development
   and financial profit were predominant aims of all youth programmes.
   Operational differences included roles, responsibility, youth to
   professional transitions and the dominant presence of a club orientation
   towards player development (n=22). Lack of proximity and formal
   communication between youth and professional environments, regardless of
   structure, led to staff dissatisfaction and appeared to hinder the
   coherent progression of young players into the professional environment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyses soccer clubs' buying choices of foreign versus local
   players through simple game theory. Restricted to a single soccer match,
   the main result indicates Prisoner's Dilemma structures in the games.
   Furthermore, the game models reveal the central (logical) trade-off in
   the clubs' player choice: a foreign player is acquired if the player's
   marginal expected financial benefit exceeds his marginal cost. Also,
   situations that are more complex and difficult to predict are analysed,
   such as foreign player cost consequences, crowding costs and diverging
   market potential between clubs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an alternative view of classical sports economic
   labour market theory. Through simple direct game theory, we are able to
   show explanations other than the traditional marginal or average revenue
   equality equilibrium models of Quirk and El-Hodiri (1971). For instance,
   the choice of objective is important, however not vital. We build our
   approach directly on preliminary research by Solberg and Haugen (2010)
   and extend their relatively simple modelling and conclusions.
   Particularly, we focus on the claimed economic crisis of European
   football and propose more complex explanatory patterns than objective
   function choice for observed financial differences between US sports and
   European football.}},

   Standardised win cost measures the ratio of sporting performance (i.e.,
   output) to financial expenditure (i.e. input). The specific version
   developed for league performance in (association) football is the wage
   cost per league point standardised across seasons to allow for changes
   in the general level of player wages as well as league restructuring.
   The use of standardised win cost to analyse team performance and
   efficiency is illustrated with data from the FA Premier League for the
   period 1995 - 2007.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the author researches the origins of Japanese baseball
   culture from the viewpoint of human social networks - focusing on Ichizo
   Kobayashi and Matsutaro Shoriki - that were used in order to establish
   and to build the financial support for Japan's first baseball
   organizations. The establishment of the pre-war professional baseball
   league in Japan was closely related to city planning strategies that
   took advantage of developing industries, such as railways, department
   stores and newspapers. The key persons associated with those strategies,
   Kobayashi and Shoriki, attracted people to baseball, by planning and
   implementing various events that stimulated public interest. A look at
   their life histories and networks of social contacts reveals that
   Japan's professional baseball league was established by virtue of their
   personal and professional connections which extended across economic,
   political and governmental circles. A brief assessment of the parallel
   development of professional football in Japan, the J-League, will also
   be addressed.}},

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Historians have almost universally seen association football in the
   north of Ireland as a divisive influence. The impacts of sectarian and
   political tensions on the game have been stressed, alongside the extent
   to which this sport supposedly feeds into existing divisions. Much of
   the work carried out has concentrated on the last four decades, though
   even studies outside this period of widespread civil disorder have
   highlighted these problems. This paper uses the surviving records of the
   Ballymena Football and Athletic Club, the local press, census returns
   and other records to consider aspects of one particular Northern Irish
   club in the 1920s and 1930s. This short consideration of the players,
   supporters and shareholders suggests that at least in this case football
   was successful in bringing together and developing cooperation between
   men of widely differing political and religious views. While the club
   was a not a financial success, it was a social and sporting one. The
   evidence available suggests there was little exhibition of sectarian
   tension at any level.}},

Title = {{Derivative Nature: interrogating the value of conservation in `Boundless
   Southern Africa'}},
Journal = {{THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{259-276}},
Abstract = {{Many conservationists nowadays talk about the urgent need to value
   nature. To bring out the `true value' of nature and make conservation
   compatible with poverty reduction, so the argument goes, it must be
   appropriated into the realm of commodities and priced in monetary terms.
   By employing the concept of `derivative nature', this paper explores the
   consequences of this neoliberal move. Derivatives are financial
   mechanisms whose monetary value is literally derived from the value of
   underlying assets. They were originally devised to reduce risk in the
   marketplace, but have actually made the global financial market
   immensely more complex and created more systemic risk and uncertainty
   because of their susceptibility to speculation. The paper suggests that
   similar processes can be seen in the arena of conservation. It argues
   that both nature and `the poor' are increasingly becoming `underlying
   assets' for what has become the `real' source of value of neoliberal
   conservation, namely images and symbols within the realms of branding,
   public relations and marketing. Empirically grounded in a discussion on
   transfrontier conservation in Southern Africa in the run-up to the 2010
   soccer World Cup, the paper examines the consequences of `derivative
   nature' and calls for critical thinking to start facing these
   consequences.}},

Title = {{THE NCAA, TAX EXEMPTION, AND COLLEGE ATHLETICS}},
Journal = {{UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS LAW REVIEW}},
Year = {{2010}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{109-163}},
Abstract = {{This Article discusses the contentions topic of the National Collegiate
   Athletic Association's (NCAA) status as a tax-exempt organization. In
   late 2006, Congress asked the NCAA to justify its exempt status, and
   since that time many have called for a change in that status. Calls for
   reform cite reasons such as the amount of money paid to Division I
   football and basketball coaches, the fact that NCAA football and
   basketball are essentially minor-league systems for the NFL and NBA, and
   an alleged lack of relation between college athletics and academics. The
   Article serves two purposes:first, it seeks to clarify the manner in
   which tax rules apply to the NCAA and universities' operation of
   Division I football and basketball programs; and second, it provides a
   policy-oriented view of whether big-time college athletic programs-and
   the NCAA-fit into a standard theoretical paradigm for exemption.
   The first part of the Article explains that, under the current laws, it
   would be nearly impossible for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to
   withdraw the NCAA's tax exemption and the tax exemptions of its member
   institutions. A more feasible alternative would be to tax Division I
   athletics revenues using the Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT). This
   option, however, presents its own legal obstacles and, if successful,
   would likely be a ``paper tiger,{''} as the NCAA and universities would
   possess little or no taxable net income after applying cost accounting.
   Further, the disclosures that universities would be required to make
   under Form 990-T would not approach the level of disclosure desired by
   reform advocates.
   The second part of the Article contends that the tax system should not
   be changed haphazardly to promote reform of NCAA athletics, and examines
   whether college sports fall into an existing paradigm for exemption or
   should be considered a class of their own for tax law purposes. If NCAA
   athletic programs do not fall into a standard paradigm, Congress would
   be able to attach conditions to their exemption without damaging
   established tax principles.
   Finally, the Article points out the existence of several regulatory
   approaches that could be applied to the taxation of college athletics.
   Those approaches consist of placing conditions upon the use of proceeds
   from collegiate football and basketball revenues, limiting athletic
   department expenditures, and mandating enhanced disclosure by the NCAA
   and its member institutions of financial information as well as the
   academic progress of student-athletes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Groin injury is a common injury in football and a
   complicated area when it comes to diagnosis and therapy. There is a lack
   of comprehensive epidemiological data on groin injuries in professional
   football.
   Objective: To investigate the incidence, pattern and severity of hip and
   groin injuries in professional footballers over seven consecutive
   seasons.
   Study design: Prospective cohort study.
   Setting: European professional football.
   Methods: During the 2001/2 to 2007/8 seasons, between nine and 17 clubs
   per season (23 clubs in total) were investigated, accounting for 88 club
   seasons in total. Time loss injuries and individual exposure during club
   and national team training sessions and matches were recorded.
   Main outcome measure: Injury incidence.
   Results: A total of 628 hip/groin injuries were recorded, accounting for
   12-16\% of all injuries per season. The total injury incidence was
   1.1/1000 h (3.5/1000 match hours vs 0.6/1000 training hours, p<0.001)
   and was consistent over the seasons studied. Eighteen different
   diagnostic entities were registered, adductor (n = 399) and iliopsoas (n
   = 52) related injuries being the most common. More than half of the
   injuries (53\%) were classified as moderate or severe (absence of more
   than a week), the mean absence per injury being 15 days. Reinjuries
   accounted for 15\% of all registered injuries. In the 2005/6 to 2007/8
   seasons, 41\% of all diagnoses relied solely on clinical examination.
   Conclusions: Hip/groin injuries are common in professional football, and
   the incidence over consecutive seasons is consistent. Hip/groin injuries
   are associated with long absences. Many hip/groin diagnoses are based
   only on clinical examination.}},

Abstract = {{We examine theoretically and experimentally a certain class of new
   financial instruments which are designed as lotteries on the outcome of
   prominent sports events like the Soccer World Cup 2006. From a
   theoretical point of view, sports betting products may be superior to a
   fixed rate investment because of heterogeneous expectations, risk-loving
   behavior of investors or additional non-monetary utility components. In
   comparison to the direct placement of bets at bookmakers', sports
   betting products may be preferable in cases of hedonic framing. Our
   experimental section, however, reveals the limited practical relevance
   of these theoretical arguments for ``average{''} decision makers.
   Despite this, financial instruments with sports betting components offer
   a certain profit potential due to the diversity of preferences across
   individuals. Summarizing, the issuance of sports betting products may
   actually be mainly driven by marketing aspects, nevertheless sports
   betting products may be considered to be `viable{''} niche products with
   low cost of capital for banks. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Soccer is one of the most widely played and complex sports in the world,
   where players need technical, tactical, and physical skills to succeed.
   Technical and tactical skills in soccer are highly dependent on the
   player's physical capacity. The selection, development and professional
   guidance of young players is a priority for many top soccer clubs in
   order to maintain their sporting and financial status. The aim of the
   present study was to determine hematological profile of youth national
   soccer tennis and to compare the values of fifteen hematological
   parameters between 3 Serbian youth national tennis (tinder 14, 15 and 16
   years old), as well as between soccer players and non-athletes. 80 young
   soccer players and 30 non-athletes participated in the study. 15
   hematologic parameters (WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, PLT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, PDW,
   LYM \%, MON \%, GRAN \%, LYM, MON, GRAN) were measured. In order to
   determine the significance of differences between the groups on a
   multivariate level a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was
   administered, and to test the differences between the groups on an
   univariate level a univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied.
   It was concluded that there is no significant difference in all the
   variables (WBC, Ly, Mo, Gr, PLT, HGB, HCT, etc), except RBC, probably
   due to age, androgen affection on erythropoesis, field positoning and
   diet. Front a practical point of view, the clinician has to take into
   account not only age, but also training status of individuals when
   evaluating their blood tests.}},

Abstract = {{We test for a relation between football match results and the specific
   national stock index returns during the period 1990-2006 by means of an
   event study approach. We employ two different econometric frameworks to
   cross-check our results and prevent them from being solely model driven:
   the constant mean model and a two-state Markov-switching market model.
   Both approaches find no significant results. Consequently, in a modified
   setup, we control for expectations about probable game results by
   applying a ``surprise{''} variable, which is computed from betting odds
   and is integrated into a regression analysis. Again, there does not seem
   to be a connection between a specific national soccer team's win or loss
   and stock index prices. In addition, through a few modifications in our
   empirical setup, we show how easy it would be to ``produce{''}
   significant results. Our results are contrary to those of Ashton et al.
   (Appl Econ Lett 10:783-785, 2003) and Edmans et al. (J Finance

Title = {{Rugby league injuries in New Zealand: a review of 8 years of Accident
   Compensation Corporation injury entitlement claims and costs}},
Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Aim: This paper provides an overview of the epidemiology of rugby league
   injuries and associated costs in New Zealand requiring medical
   treatment.
   Method: New Zealand national Accident Compensation Corporation injury
   data for the period 1999 to 2007 were searched for rugby league injury
   cases. Data were analysed by demographics, body region, nature/severity
   of injury, and medical procedure and costs.
   Results: A total of 5941 injury entitlement claims were recorded over
   the study period with a significant decrease observed in the injury rate
   between the 1999-2000 and 2002-2003 reporting years. The total cost of
   the injuries for the study period was \$42 822 048 (equivalent to L15
   916 072). The mean (SD) number of injury entitlement claims per year was
   743 (271) and yearly cost was \$5 352 760 (L1 989 880) (\$2 485 535
   (L923 994)). The knee was the most commonly reported injury site (225
   per 1000 entitlement claims; \$8 750 147 (L3 252 020)) and soft tissue
   injuries were the most common injury types (474 per 1000 entitlement
   claims; \$17 324 214 (L6 438 599)). Accounting for only 1.8\% of total
   injury entitlement claims, concussion/brain injuries accounted for 6.3\%
   of injury entitlement costs and had the highest mean cost per claim
   (\$25 347 (L9420)). The upper and lower arm recorded the highest mean
   injury site claim cost of \$43 096 (L16 016) per claim. The 25-29 age
   group recorded 27.7\% of total injury entitlement claims and 29.6\% of
   total injury entitlement costs, which was slightly more than the 20-24
   age group (27.3\% claims; 24.7\% costs). Nearly 15\% of total moderate
   to serious injury entitlement claims and 20\% of total costs were
   recorded from participants 35 years or older.
   Discussion: This study identified that the knee was the most common
   injury site and soft tissue injuries were the most common injury type
   requiring medical treatment, which is consistent with other
   international studies on rugby league epidemiology. This study also
   highlights that the rate of injury and the average age of injured rugby
   league players increased over time. The high cost of concussion/brain
   injuries is a cause for concern as it reflects the severity of the
   injuries.
   Conclusion: Injury prevention programmes for rugby league should focus
   on reducing the risk of concussion/brain injury and knee and soft tissue
   injury, and should target participants in the 20-30 years old age range.
   More longitudinal epidemiological studies with specific details on
   injury mechanisms and participation data are warranted to further
   identify the injury circumstances surrounding participation in rugby
   league activities.}},

Abstract = {{The use of generic equations for estimating percent body fat from
   skinfold thicknesses can be criticised when applied to specific sports.
   The present aims were to compare existing methods of using skinfold data
   and to derive an equation for predicting body fat values in professional
   soccer players. Forty-five professional soccer players (24.2 +/- 5.0
   years; 82.0 +/- 8.5 kg: 1.82 +/- 0.07 m) participated. Skinfold
   thicknesses were assessed at eight sites for the application of existing
   prediction equations. Skinfold data were also utilised to determine a
   novel soccer-specific equation. All players had a reference estimate of
   percent fat by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The existing
   skinfold equations differed from the DXA-referenced values by varying
   degrees, the equation of Withers et al. (1987) demonstrating the lowest
   bias and highest relationship and agreement with DXA. Regression
   analysis resulted in an equation incorporating anterior thigh,
   abdominal, triceps and medial calf sites, accounting for 78.4\% variance
   in DXA criterion Values.}},

Abstract = {{An ongoing controversy in the literature on the economics of higher
   education centers on whether the success of a school's athletic program
   affects alumni donations. This paper uses a unique data set to
   investigate this issue. The data contain detailed information about
   donations made by alumni of a selective research university as well as a
   variety of their economic and demographic characteristics. One important
   question is how to characterize the success of an athletic program. We
   focus not only on the performance of the most visible teams, football
   and basketball, but also oil the success of the team on which he or she
   played as an undergraduate.
   One of our key findings is that the impact of athletic success on
   donations differs for men and women. When a male graduate's former team
   wins its conference championship, his donations for general purposes
   increase by about 7\% and his donations to the athletic program increase
   by about the same percentage. Football and basketball records generally
   have small and statistically insignificant effects; in some
   specifications, a winning basketball season reduces donations. For women
   there is no statistically discernible effect of a former team's success
   on current giving; as is the case for men, the impacts of football and
   basketball, while statistically significant in some specifications, are
   not important in magnitude. Another novel result is that for males,
   varsity athletes whose teams were successful when they were
   undergraduates subsequently make larger donations to the athletic
   program. For example, if a male alumnus's team won its conference
   championship during his senior year, his subsequent giving to the
   athletic program is about 8\% a year higher, ceteris paribus. (C) 2008

Title = {{Cost Analysis of Converting From Single-Bundle to Double-Bundle Anterior
   Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{683-687}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Recent studies comparing double-bundle anterior cruciate
   ligament reconstruction to single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament
   reconstruction have reported some biomechanical advantages but little or
   no short-term clinical benefit from the double-bundle technique. In the
   current healthcare environment, the potential economic implications of
   widespread conversion to a double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament
   reconstruction are an important consideration.
   Purpose: To determine the economic implications of widespread use of the
   double-bundle technique for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
   Study Design: Economic analysis; Level of evidence, 2.
   Methods: A cost model to assess the effect of double-bundle anterior
   cruciate ligament reconstruction was constructed using standard
   accounting methodology. The model was based on actual 2008 cost figures
   (in US dollars) for ligamentous allografts, fixation implants, and
   operating room time. Revision rate (4\%) and time to revision surgery
   (mean, 4 years) for single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament
   reconstruction was based on the available literature. Assumptions about
   the prevalence of double-bundle versus single-bundle anterior cruciate
   ligament reconstruction, the number of grafts used, and the revision
   rate for double-bundle reconstruction were varied to assess their effect
   on cost.
   Results: The potential additional cost for widespread conversion to the
   double-bundle technique for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
   ranges from \$36 million to \$792 million per year in the United States
   alone. To offset this increased cost, the double-bundle technique would
   have to reduce the revision rate at a minimum from 4\% to 1.5\% and
   potentially from 24.1\% to 0\%.
   Conclusion: Double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction has
   the potential of adding considerable cost to the healthcare system.
   Clinical Relevance: While further research is warranted to determine if
   there are other benefits from this technique, widespread adoption of a
   double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction does not appear
   to be cost-effective at this time.}},

Abstract = {{This qualitative case study used tenets of critical race theory and a
   single focus group and individual into-views with 4 African American
   football athletes at a predominantly White institution of higher
   education (PWIHE) in an effort, to bring the voices of this marginalized
   group into the dialogue on issues concerning institutional integrity in
   college sport. Institutional integrity involves an athletic program's
   actual commitment to the educational interests Of college athletes as
   expressed through their structures, functions, and activities. Three
   themes emerged from the data: (a) there is a need for more African
   American role models in leadership positions within the athletic
   departments of these PWIHE; (b) there is a need for more financial
   support for athletes; and (c) African American athletes should be given
   a platform to voice concerns. These findings have implications for those
   educational stakeholders and researchers who are genuinely concerned
   with institutional integrity in college sport.}},

   management is overdetermined by emerging financial opportunities in

   I identify how vicarious management offers new opportunities for
   integrating and expanding corporate reach while constructing, masculine
   athletic subjectivity in ways that addresses deeply felt anxieties in

Abstract = {{In past decades, many empirical studies revealed return anomalies in
   many different asset classes and markets. Very recent publications have,
   however, even found evidence that stock markets react to the results of
   soccer matches. In this article, we argue that such empirical studies
   should be analysed carefully; we thus endorse the use of replication
   studies to verify results. Consequently, by rebuilding the study of
   Ashton et al. (2003), we are able to detect mistakes in the empirical
   set-up. Based on these findings, we demonstrate how even minor flaws can
   have a crucial influence on the results of such studies and point out
   pitfalls that are frequently encountered. We furthermore emphasize the
   importance of robustness checks to validate the results of empirical
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was twofold: a) to verify the previously
   detected regularities in a group of subjects larger than the one
   employed in a pilot study, and b) to define the internal structure of
   the hierarchy of values that can be squandered as a result of doping.
   For the study, eighty-nine 16-18-year-old students from the fencing,
   athletics, martial arts, and football classes of the School of
   Championship in Sports were recruited. Experimental technique developed
   by Mroczkowska called ``Perception of the risk of doping{''} was
   employed to individually rank the highly regarded values (e.g., health,
   medals won, physical appeal, mental balance, financial bonuses, and
   social respect) that can be lost as a consequence of the use of illegal
   stimulants. It appears that young athletes would declaratively resign
   themselves from the loss of a financial bonus rather than from the loss
   of the social respect and attributes of self-integrity, such as physical
   and mental health. The detected correlations suggest that the rewarding
   value of a medal has an internal dimension: it externalizes a sense of
   self-confidence and confirms high self-esteem. The results indicate
   that, as perceived by the young, winning a medal with the help of doping
   is an illusion that does not allow to verify one's own skills and
   limitations. (Biol.Sport 26.235-243, 2009)}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to identify the risk management issues in
   large-scale sporting events from the perspective of the organizing
   committee members and stakeholders. A comparative case study analysis of
   two major Canadian sporting events (the International Skating Union 2006
   World Figure Skating Championships and the U-20 Federation
   Internationale de Football Association World Cup Canada 2007) was
   conducted through analysis of archival material and interviews. A
   revised definition of risk management emerged from the data: ``risk
   management is a proactive process that involves assessing all possible
   risks to the events and its stakeholders by strategically anticipating,
   preventing, minimizing, and planning responses to mitigate those
   identified risks''. Fifteen risk issue categories were also identified
   by the various stakeholder groups. The categories were: environment,
   financial, human resources, infrastructure, interdependence, legacy,
   media, operations, organizing, participation, political, relationships,
   sport, threats, and visibility.}},

   the Yugoslav conflict, twinned with a complex transition to a market

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show how one of the biggest
   phenomena of the twenty-first century is the internationalisation of
   professional sports and how premier league football epitomises this.
   With the influx of foreign players, managers and now owners.
   Design/methodology/approach- Thu approach adopted id purely qualitative
   in nature, evaluating the top Barclays Premier League teams and the
   impact of globalisation on their reconfigurations since the early 1990s
   to date. The study draw,; mainly from a review of the extant oil sports
   and management. as well as a critical analysis of media reports.
   Findings - Globalisation has emerged as a new force that has changed the
   way Corporations are managed Financial services, retail and information
   technology firms have all responded to this new wave - and so also has
   sports. Unfortunately while sports have the potential to teach lessons
   oil management strategy, management researchers seem to have relegated
   sport,, to the sociology and psychology disciplines.
   Practical implications The Barclays Premier league. football provides it
   unique environment for managment decisions and processes to occur in a
   range of markets and at varied levels. However, the globalisation of
   professional sports has received relatively very little attention in the
   academic literature especially in the field of business and management.
   Originality/value - This paper contributes to the scant literature oil
   the management implications of football by highlighting how
   globalisation has affected and reconfigured professional sports using
   the influx of foreign players into the English football league as a
   point of departure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the financial incentives for entities to self-impose
   punishments post-apprehension but before the enforcement body imposes
   punishment. We argue that violators punish themselves in order to affect
   the level and type of total punishment. Violators may be able to choose
   the punishment that minimizes lost revenue. The model includes an
   enforcing body whose objective is to be perceived as fair by the public.
   We consider the case of university self-sanctions for National
   Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) violations to test our
   self-punishment model using data from Division I schools' major
   infractions of NCAA rules. The estimation results show that university
   self-imposed punishments can significantly affect the form or type of
   the final punishment they receive from the NCAA in response to a
   violation of NCAA rules.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to describe barriers influencing dietary
   practices of elite-level athletes using a focus-group design involving
   discussions with elite-level athletes, coaches and sports dietitians.
   The participants were sixteen male and thirty female elite athletes from
   an Australian State Institute of Sport, representing diving, netball,
   basketball and lawn bowls; twelve elite coaches representing swimming,
   diving, soccer, sailing, cycling and golf; and sixteen sports dietitians
   who consulted to state institutes/academies of sport with various
   sports. Focus groups were audio-taped and transcribed with in-depth
   notes also recorded during the groups. Thematic coding of transcripts
   and notes were undertaken by the primary coder and these themes were
   subsequently evaluated by the research team. A number of barriers to
   healthy eating were described. Lack of time for food preparation was a
   significant barrier raised by all groups. Financial limitations,
   inadequate cooking skills and difficulty with living arrangements also
   rated high among all three groups. Coaches were concerned with excess
   body weight and fat levels and perceived an impact on sports
   performance. Athletes reported concern about body shape due to societal
   pressures. Sports dietitians and coaches were concerned with issues
   relating to optimal dietary provision surrounding travel to and from
   training and competition. A range of barriers influence the diet of
   athletes, in particular time and financial constraints in addition to
   specific physique requirements. Health professionals working with elite
   athletes need to be aware of these barriers when assessing dietary
   intake, or designing nutrition interventions. Dietitians may need to
   advocate on behalf of athletes to facilitate increased financial or
   professional support to assist athletes to choose and then maintain
   healthy diet practices.}},

Title = {{The strategic positioning and configuration of national mapping
   organisations as enablers of economic and social growth in South Africa}},
Journal = {{SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the transferability and application of
   business-driven strategic thinking to that of a public sector context,
   namely national mapping organisations. These organisations exist
   throughout the world because the economies of the world require
   geospatial information to support economic and social growth. As such
   their strategic positioning within government is of prime importance. In
   South Africa, however, there is a paucity of knowledge in this regard
   and consequently triggered the research which forms the basis of this
   paper.
   A macro-environmental analysis suggests significant growth opportunities
   for the South African geospatial industry, fuelled by a micro-industry
   borne out of the 2010 Soccer World Cup event. A profile description of
   the characteristics of consequence, boundaries between the private and
   public the industry and expected changes reflect a large industry which
   is expanding at a rapid rate but is fragmented and displays a complex
   network-system of inter and intra-industry relationships. As such it is
   attracting increasing numbers of competitors but, as an industry,
   appears to be slow to adjust to technological advancement. An internal
   analysis of the value chain of the National Mapping Organisation (NMO),
   the single most important player in the local public sector geospatial
   industry, reveals significant value creation in its in-house activities.
   However, the external deconstructed operations, outbound logistics and
   procurement processes are not allowing the organisation to realise any
   benefits from efficiencies it may introduce. Key to achieving
   efficiencies lies in the human capital, which by all accounts, it is
   failing to retain.
   Future strategic thrusts for the NMO have been identified by
   constructing a SWOT model and by analysing its relative competitive
   strength. These thrusts were found to concentrate on actions and themes
   related to staff, communication, marketing, general management,
   production (cost and capacity) and product (quality and innovation).
   Interpreting and applying those themes on an interorganisational basis
   will enable the NMO to best position itself in the industry. In this
   regard sufficient related strategic fit is evident between the value
   chains of the NMO, The Satellite Application Centre (SAC) and Statistics
   South Africa (Stats SA), enabling the NMO to leverage on the sales,
   marketing and distribution activities of SAC and the financial
   leveraging capabilities of Stats SA.
   This paper has presented an example of how delivering an efficient and
   effective service delivery may be hampered through the inappropriate
   strategic configuration of South African public sector activities. It is
   therefore suggested that the government revisits the strategic
   positioning of public sector organisations engaged in the provision of
   geospatial information.}},

Abstract = {{The 5-jump test (5JT) was proposed to evaluate lower limb explosive
   power of athletes competing in various disciplines. Although 5JT
   performance is usually expressed in absolute terms as the overall
   distance covered (i.e., in meters), subject size can play a significant
   role in the performance. The aims of the present study were to test the
   relationship of 5JT absolute performance with laboratory tests for
   explosive power and to develop performance notations useful to improve
   the diagnostic value of 5JT. Fifteen elite soccer players, members of
   the Under-23 Tunisian national team, were tested for 5JT, force platform
   vertical jumping ( squat jump {[}SJ] and arm-aided countermovement jump
   {[}Arm-CMJ]), and concentric isokinetic leg extension/flexion (90
   degrees.s(-1) and 240 degrees.s(-1)). 5JT performance was expressed in
   absolute terms ( meters), relative to leg length (5JT-relative) and with
   body mass-dependent notations ( Body mass X 5JT, 5JT-body mass). 5JT
   performance was significantly correlated with SJ height and scaled
   (W.kg(-0.67)) peak power (0.72 and 0.77, respectively, p < 0.01).
   5JT-relative values were significantly related to SJ and Arm-CMJ height
   (0.61 and 0.71, respectively, p < 0.05) and scaled peak power (0.57 and
   0.59, respectively, p < 0.05). 5JT-body mass revealed significantly
   related of SJ (0.82, p < 0.0001) and Arm-CMJ peak power (0.54, p < 0.05)
   and to SJ and Arm-CMJ peak force (0.67 and 0.65, respectively p < 0.05).
   5JT-relative and 5JT-body mass correlated significantly with knee
   extensors 240 degrees.s(-1) (0.60, p < 0.05) and knee flexors 90
   degrees.s(-1) (0.67, p < 0.01) isokinetic acceleration time,
   respectively. The results of this study suggest that the 5JT may be
   regarded as an explosive strength diagnostic tool under field conditions
   in elite soccer players. The use of performance notation accounting for
   body size differences may improve the diagnostic ability of 5JT.}},

Abstract = {{Past research concerning the effects of college athletics has
   concentrated on examining the effects of on-field success on increased
   donations to the university and increased enrollment applications. This
   research examines the effects of a university's move to NCAA Division
   I-A football membership on marketing variables, such as attitudes toward
   the university, perceptions of the university, and behavioral intentions
   regarding attendance at sporting events and donating money. Members of
   three important stakeholder groups (students, alumni, and area
   residents) responded to questions dealing with a university's recent
   move to Division I-A football. With respect to overall perceptions of
   I-A football and reactions to the University's recent move to I-A,
   students, alumni, and the general public believe that I-A football is
   more prestigious than I-AA football. Further, I-A football status can
   create a positive image for a university, can attract students to attend
   the university, is the best sport for fostering alumni involvement with
   the university, and it enhances school spirit. These results suggest
   that the positive perceptions associated with I-A can create the solid
   foundation upon which additional (future) positive experiences and
   associations can build, leading to greater financial gains in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the use of psychology services in teams of the

   determine the composition of the multidisciplinary teams. The response
   rate was 81.8\% (77 of 94). Though most teams have different
   professionals employed on a full-time basis, only 15.6\% of these teams
   have a sport psychologist. Moreover, only three teams have a full-time
   sports psychologist. These results indicate that, compared to other
   professional services, managers and/or coaches do not perceive the need
   for psychological services. We discarded the hypothesis that most of the
   teams do not hire psychologists due to financial reasons. Sport
   psychology associations should reinforce the importance of the

Abstract = {{Professional football clubs are unusual businesses, their performance
   judged on and off the field of play. This study is concerned with
   measuring the efficiency of clubs in the English Premier League.
   Information from clubs' financial statements is used as a measure of
   corporate performance. To measure changes in efficiency and productivity
   the Malmquist non-parametric technique has been used. This is derived
   from the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) linear programming approach,
   with Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) being used to ensure the
   cohesion of the input-output variables. The study concludes that while
   clubs operate close to efficient levels for the assessed models, there
   is limited technological advance in their performance in terms of the
   displacement of the technological frontier.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies intercollegiate athletics in the context of the
   theory of cartels. Some point to the explicit attempts by the National
   Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to restrict output and payments
   for factors of production as evidence of cartel behavior. Others argue
   that such limits enhance product quality by preserving amateurism. I
   find that the NCAA's compensation limits on athletes lead to high levels
   of rents from the entertainment revenues produced by the athletes, a
   finding consistent with the cartel interpretation. The athletes
   producing these rents are disproportionately African-American, while the
   beneficiaries are primarily white. The rents are typically spent on
   facilities, nonrevenue sports, and, possibly, head coaches' salaries.
   Big-time football and men's basketball programs earn accounting profits,
   although the athletic departments in which they reside make accounting
   losses on average. However, there is some evidence, albeit not
   unanimous, that sports generate alumni contributions, state
   appropriations, and additional student applications. But, arms race
   considerations suggest that there may be some societal gains to the
   aggregate limitation of spending on college athletics.}},

Abstract = {{This case describes the implementation and subsequent failure of an
   innovative system installed in the bars of Alvalade XXI, the recently
   built football stadium in Lisbon, Portugal. Casa XXI, the company
   running the bars, had entrusted the project to an IT supplier who had
   limited experience with large systems. During the inauguration, the
   system failed spectacularly creating a chaotic situation. The fiasco
   meant not only a financial loss, but also a blow to the reputation of
   the company. The management blamed the supplier for the failure. The
   supplier, however, claimed that the problem was not technical but
   organizational, that is, poor planning of operations. Subsequent tests
   were inconclusive and failed to restore trust. At the end of the case,
   the CEO is considering the possibility to switch to an alternative
   supplier. He also wonders what they could have done to manage the
   project and the associated risks more effectively. The case highlights
   risk and project management issues in large systems implementations. The
   discussion can be structured around cost/benefit analysis, risk
   assessment, and project management. Relevant dimensions include: company
   operations, project scope, degree of innovation, technology used, system
   architecture, supplier selection, and project organization. In addition,
   the case raises governance questions: Who is responsible for the
   project? Even if the project is outsourced, how should the roles and
   responsibilities be apportioned between the company and the IT
   supplier(s)? What mechanisms should be used to plan and execute IT
   projects, and control their risks?}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the implications of exceptions to the National
   Football League's (NFL) earlier principles of financial equity and
   competitive parity across teams. The exception to financial equity is
   that revenue from premium seating is not shared. The exception to
   competitive parity is that the salary cap, used to engender parity does
   not include coaching salaries. The fact that teams, along with stadium
   owners, can exchange general seating for premium seating makes the
   degree of revenue sharing an endogenous variable. Empirical evidence
   suggests that teams in larger, wealthier markets have a greater
   incentive to increase the number of premium seats, and thus reduce the
   degree of revenue sharing, and to acquire greater coaching talent. The
   evidence also indicates that teams in larger, wealthier markets earn
   significantly more revenue, much of which is unshared revenue, and on
   the margin, have a greater probability of making the playoffs.}},

Abstract = {{This article contends that a French football exception is not on absent
   financial crisis but its hidden shape because of undisciplined club
   behavior and a lack of transparency and disclosure. French football is
   characterized by a lax financial management and a soft-budget constraint
   at the club level. The latter results from a weak governance structure
   in the league and clubs. Shareholders behave as non-profit-seeking
   investors or patrons. The arms race to enroll the most efficient players
   fuels wage inflation that is hardly balanced by newly emerging sources
   of finance. The more a club is able to attract broadcast revenues, the
   more likely it is to be in the red. Policy recommendations include
   strengthening the governance structure, restoring financial discipline,
   and defining compulsory thresholds for some clubs' financial ratios.}},

Abstract = {{The peculiar German football governance structure may be well suited to
   prevent integrity problems resulting from multiple club ownership or
   from ownership by ``undesired{''} persons or entities. However, this
   effect comes at a price. In the vacuum of power generated within large
   member associations, residual rights of control are de facto allocated
   to representatives who do not hold residual claims. Because these
   representatives externalize substantial parts of the risk associated
   with investment decisions, they are particularly ill-suited for managing
   the business of professional football, which has been transformed into a
   ``gamble on success{''} by ever-increasing revenue differentials between
   winners and losers. At the some time, low accounting standards for
   members clubs, combined with ``soft{''} low enforcement, invite club
   representatives to hide their consumption on the job behavior until
   their clubs are insolvent.}},

Abstract = {{An evidence-based review was undertaken of the literature published
   between 2002 and 2006 about sports, trauma and ALS in order to see if
   there were new data to modify the conclusions of a previous review
   (2003). The new data support the previous conclusions that physical
   activity and trauma are probably ({''}more likely than not{''}) not risk
   factors for ALS (Level 11 conclusions). This review concludes also that
   the reports of an apparent excess of ALS in Italian soccer players
   likely reflect incorrect analysis of the data. The appearance of excess
   relies on accepting as valid estimation methods resulting in improbably
   low numbers of expected cases. A different method is proposed: it
   generates more plausible numbers of expected cases, compared to which
   there is no excess of total cases (Level C conclusion). A theoretical
   framework is developed to analyze the possible influence of a ``healthy
   worker effect{''} on incidence of neurodegenerative diseases in cohorts
   of employed or formerly employed individuals. In lieu of theoretical
   speculations, data are needed to measure this effect, while controlling
   for known lifestyle factors and accounting for the effect of loss of
   competing causes of mortality. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Hurricane Katrina devastated the city of New Orleans in late August
   2005, resulting in damage to much of the city's sports infrastructure
   and the departure of both of New Orleans' major-league professional
   sports teams, the National Football League Saints and the National
   Basketball Association Hornets. What should the city provide in the way
   of financial accommodation to encourage them to return? This paper
   suggests that post-Katrina New Orleans will have a difficult time
   retaining their franchises over the long run and in attempting to do so
   may hinder the redevelopment of the city. Furthermore, the very
   incentives designed to attract teams in the first place leave cities
   vulnerable to their departure in times of crisis. Finally, playing host
   to professional sports and mega-events does have symbolic significance,
   but it is arguable that this is an amenity the city cannot currently
   afford.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, economic theory has been expanded to incorporate emotions,
   which have been assumed to play an important role in financial
   decisions. The present study illustrates this by showing a connection
   between the sports performance of popular national football teams
   (Besiktas, Fenerbahce, and Galatasaray) and performance of the Turkish
   economy. Specifically, a significant positive association was found
   between the success of three major professional Turkish football teams
   and the exchange rate of the Turkish lira against the U.S. dollar. The
   effect of the football success of several Turkish football teams on the
   exchange rate of the Turkish lira was examined using the simultaneous
   multiple regression model with predictor measures of wins, losses, and
   ties for different combinations of teams to predict the depreciation
   rate of the Turkish lira between the years 1987 and 2003. Wins by
   Turkish football teams against foreign (non-Turkish) rivals increased
   with exchange rate depreciation of the Turkish lira against the U.S.
   dollar.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. Several studies, such as Hoberman ( 1997) and Leeds ( 2003),
   have claimed that success in the athletic arena has distorted the human
   capital decisions of young black men. We test this hypothesis by
   determining how participation in interscholastic athletics affects the
   study habits of black and white youths. Methods. We build a theoretical
   model that allows youths to invest in athletic or academic human
   capital. We test this model using data from the National Educational
   Longitudinal Survey and accounting for possible self-selection bias.
   Results. We find that athletic participation does not have a
   statistically significant impact on the amount of time young black men
   and women spend studying. The impact for young white men and women is
   positive and significant, though the impact of playing football and
   basketball does have a negative impact for young white men. Conclusions.
   Participating in interscholastic athletics does not have the pervasive
   negative impact on young black men that Hoberman ( 1997) and Leeds (
   2003) claim. The expected negative impact of basketball and football -
   the so-called money sports - exists for young white men, though this is
   offset by the positive impact of participation in athletics per se.}},

   graduation rates. After accounting for differences in racial
   composition, graduation rates for male athletes overall as well football

   account for over one-quarter of the shortfall in men's basketball

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between
   game-specific attendance in Major League Soccer (MLS) and the presence
   of Freddy Adu in matches during the 2004 season. A demand model for
   attendance during Adu's first year in MLS was estimated using ordinary
   least squares and fixed-effects multiple-regression analysis. The
   regression equation explained 67\% of the variation in game-specific
   attendance and 9 of the 22 explanatory variables were statistically
   significant at the .05 level. It was found that an additional 10,958
   spectators attended games in which Freddy Adu was playing, holding all
   else constant. Furthermore, it was estimated that these additional
   spectators generated about \$3.25 million in revenue from ticket,
   concession, and merchandise sales in the 2004 season. This amount is far
   greater than the \$500,000 annual salary paid to Adu, and the findings
   support the claim that from a financial perspective the signing of the
   14-year old Adu was highly beneficial to MLS.}},

Title = {{Epidemiology of collegiate injuries for 15 sports: Summary and
   recommendations for injury prevention initiatives}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ATHLETIC TRAINING}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{311-319}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To summarize 16 years of National Collegiate Athletic
   Association (NCAA) injury surveillance data for 15 sports and to
   identify potential modifiable risk factors to target for injury
   prevention initiatives.
   Background. In 1982, the NCAA began collecting standardized injury and
   exposure data for collegiate sports through its Injury Surveillance
   System (ISS). This special issue reviews 182000 injuries and slightly
   more than 1 million exposure records captured over a 16-year time period
   (1988-1989 through 2003-2004). Game and practice injuries that required
   medical attention and resulted in at least 1 day of time loss were
   included. An exposure was defined as 1 athlete participating in 1
   practice or game and is expressed as an athlete-e:KPOSure (AE).
   Main Results: Combining data for all sports, injury rates were
   statistically significantly higher in games (13.8 injuries per 1000
   A-Es) than in practices (4.0 injuries per 1000 A-Es), and preseason
   practice injury rates (6.6 injuries per 1000 A-Es) were significantly
   higher than both in-season (2.3 injuries per 1000 A-Es) and postseason
   (1.4 injuries per 1000 A-Es) practice rates. No significant change in
   game or practice injury rates was noted over the 16 years. More than
   50\% of all injuries were to the lower extremity. Ankle ligament sprains
   were the most common injury over all sports, accounting for 15\% of all
   reported injuries. Rates of concussions and anterior cruciate ligament
   injuries increased significantly (average annual increases of 7.0\% and
   1.3\%, respectively) over the sample period. These trends may reflect
   improvements in identification of these injuries, especially for
   concussion, over time. Football had the highest injury rates for both
   practices (9.6 injuries per 1000 AEs) and games (35.9 injuries per 1000
   A-Es), whereas men's baseball had the lowest rate in practice (1.9
   injuries per 1000 A\_Es) and women's softball had the lowest rate in
   games (4.3 injuries per 1000 A-Es).
   Recommendations: In general, participation in college athletics is safe,
   but these data indicate modifiable factors that, if addressed through
   injury prevention initiatives, may contribute to lower injury rates in
   collegiate sports.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms and difficulty
   with pain in retired professional football players, difficulties with
   the transition from active athletic competition to retirement,
   perceptions of barriers to receiving assistance for those difficulties,
   and recommended programs to provide such assistance. Methods: Survey
   sent to 3377 retired members of the National Football League Players
   Association (NFLPA), with usable responses received from 1617 members
   (functional response rate, 48.6\%). Results: Respondents were
   categorized as experiencing no to mild depression (N = 1366; 84.5\%) or
   moderate to severe depression (N = 237; 14.7\%). Respondents were also
   categorized according to whether they reported difficulty with pain as
   not or somewhat common (N = 837; 51.8\%) versus quite or very common (N
   = 769; 47.6\%). Respondents most frequently reported trouble sleeping,
   financial difficulties, marital or relationship problems, and problems
   with fitness, exercise, and aging, all of which were strongly correlated
   with the presence of moderate to severe depression and with quite or
   very common difficulty with pain. The same difficulties were even more
   commonly experienced by respondents who reported both moderate to severe
   depression and quite or very common difficulty with pain, compared with
   those who reported low scores in both domains. Conclusion: Retired
   professional football players experience levels of depressive symptoms
   similar to those of the general population, but the impact of these
   symptoms is compounded by high levels of difficulty with pain. The
   combination of depression and pain is strongly predictive of significant
   difficulties with sleep, social relationships, financial difficulties,
   and problems with exercise and fitness. A hypothesis explaining this
   association is that significant musculoskeletal disability and chronic
   pain interferes with physical activity and fitness during retirement and
   increases the risk of depression.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Children presenting with sport related injuries (SRIs) as a
   result of soccer, rugby and gaelic football are frequently seen in an
   emergency medicine (EM) setting in Ireland. A comparison of the
   demographics of injuries in these three sports has however not
   previously been performed. The purpose of this study was to provide
   up-to-date data on the nature of these SRIs.
   Method: Data was collected retrospectively on at{[} children (<17 years
   of age), injured in these three sports, presenting to an emergency
   medicine department over 6 months, and was entered into a database for
   analysis. Results: Retrospective analysis was performed on 23,000
   charts, and 409 SRIs were identified over a 6-month period. None of the
   children reported using any form of protective gear, and 27\% reported a
   previous presentation to the emergency department with a SRI. Most
   injuries were as a result of soccer (56\%), with 24\% occurring in
   gaelic football, and 20\% occurring in rugby. The predominant mechanism
   of injury was different in each sport, in soccer-falls (38\%), in gaelic
   football-collisions with objects (balls) (37\%), and in rugby-collision
   with persons (55\%). Although the predominant type of injury in soccer
   and gaelic football was a fracture, accounting for 50\% and 42\% of
   injuries, respectively, in rugby however, skin/soft tissue injuries
   presented more commonly, accounting for 44\% of injuries. When the
   general site of injury was investigated, the upper limb accounted for
   the majority of SRIs in each sport. In the management of SRIs, oral
   analgesics were prescribed in 50\%, however, it was observed that no use
   was made of topical, intramuscular or rectal analgesic routes of
   administration. In addition it was observed that RICE/general injury
   advice was given in only 27\%, physiotherapy was requested in 2\%, and
   no injury prevention advice was given to any child. Overall, 8\%
   required admission.
   Conclusions: The data provided from this study may raise awareness of
   the nature of SRIs affecting children in each of these three sports, and
   may be useful in formulating much needed injury prevention strategies.

Journal = {{MANAGEMENT DECISION}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{841-852}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to help demonstrate the extent to
   which socio-cultural and market-oriented incentives jointly contribute
   to corporate control outcomes that prevail in the UK football industry.
   Design/methodology/approach - Illustrative case studies informed by
   analysis of financial performance data, discussion with key informants,
   review of official documents.
   Findings - The paper finds long term performance outcomes were
   influenced in substantive ways by actions led by shareholder groups
   pursuing largely non-market-oriented objectives.
   Research limitations/implications - Industry-specific empirical work
   that analyses how the interplay between voice and exit strategies
   influences corporate control outcomes is limited. This paper focuses on
   two UK cases and therefore would benefit expansion to further UK cases
   and comparative analyses to non-UK situations.
   Practical implications - The outcomes suggest that the market for
   corporate control in this particular industry context requires specific
   attention to actions driven by largely non-market-driven incentives.
   Originality/value - Previous papers have not provided detailed
   empirical-based evidence about how socio-cultural concerns have
   influenced corporate control outcomes in the case studies provided.}},

Title = {{Loading modalities and bone structures at nonweight-bearing upper
   extremity and weight-bearing lower extremity: A pQCT study of adult
   female athletes}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{886-894}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This cross-sectional study of adult female athletes assessed whether the
   apparent loading-related differences in bone structure are primarily
   associated with the loading type or the muscle performance-related joint
   moments. Several structural variables at shaft sites of the tibia,
   radius and humerus, and distal sites of the tibia and radius were
   measured with peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) among
   113 female national level athletes (representing hurdling, volleyball,
   soccer, racket-sports and swimming) and their 30 nonathletic referents.
   For the weight-bearing lower extremities, the loading modalities of the
   above sports were classified into high-impact (hurdling, volleyball),
   odd-impact (soccer, racket-sports) and repetitive, nonimpact (swimming)
   loadings; and for the nonweight-bearing upper extremities into high
   magnitude (functional weightlifting in hurdling and soccer), impact
   (volleyball, racket-sports) and repetitive, nonimpact (swimming)
   loadings.
   As expected, athletes' bone mass was substantially higher at loaded bone
   sites compared with the nonathletic referents, but more pertinently to
   the locomotive perspective, the loading-induced additional bone mass
   seemed to be used to build mechanically strong and appropriate bone
   structures. Compared with controls, the weight-bearing bone structures
   of female athletes (swimmers excluded) were characterized by larger
   diaphysis, thicker cortices and somewhat denser trabecular bone. The
   athletes' bones at the nonweight-bearing upper extremity were generally
   larger in cross-sectional area. The estimated indices of joint moment
   (muscle force x estimated lever arm) were explained from 29\% to 50\%,
   and the loading modalities from 8\% to 25\%, of the variance in most
   bone variables (P < 0.05) of the tibia (shaft and distal site). In
   contrast to the weight-beating tibia, only the estimated joint moment
   was positively associated (P < 0.05) with the structural characteristics
   of the radius and humerus, accounting for 6\% to 26\% of the variance in
   bone variables of the shafts of these bones. Such association was not
   observed at the distal radius.
   In conclusion, at the weight-bearing lower extremity, the strong bone
   structure of the female athletes was attributable to muscle
   performance-related estimated joint moments and impact loading modality.
   At the shaft sites of the nonweight-bearing upper extremity, the strong
   bone structure was mainly attributable to the estimated joint moments.
   Thus, different loading history and other features of loading seemed to
   govern the skeletal adaptation at the upper and lower extremity. (c)

Abstract = {{In this study, we examine the factors that contribute to the financial
   performance of clubs in the Australian Football League over the period
   from 1993 to 2002. Primarily, we examine the association between the
   on-field football success of clubs and their level of off-field
   financial performance. We find that match attendance is positively
   related to both short-term and long-term success of football clubs and
   also to the uncertainty as to the match outcome (i.e. the expected
   closeness of the match). We also find that club membership is highly
   persistent and is positively related to both the past football success
   of the club and the marketing expense incurred. Finally, we find that
   there is a significant association between the level of marketing
   revenue and the level of on-field success in the prior 2 years.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to discover (if and) what kind of
   strategic actions European football clubs conduct and whether these
   actions affect their financial performance and therefore their
   competitive position. In this paper we measure the context, content and
   process dimensions of strategic renewal and relate these to financial
   performance. The individual strategic actions undertaken by eight
   football organisations during the period 1995-2002 were examined. In
   total, 963 strategic actions could be assigned to three dimensions of
   strategic action. Our study shows that even in an environment in which
   other factors are crucial for surviving, undertaking strategic actions
   does contribute to the financial performance of firms. In the European
   football industry that requires some kind of `competitive balance',
   strategic actions positively contribute to financial performance.}},

Abstract = {{Simple statistical and probabilistic arguments are used to value the
   most commonly traded online soccer spread bets. Such markets typically
   operate dynamically during the course of a match and accurate valuations
   must, therefore, reflect the changing state of the match. Both goals and
   corners are assumed to evolve as Poisson processes with constant means.
   Although many of the bets that are typically traded are relatively easy
   to value, some (including the `four flags' market) require more detailed
   analysis. Examples are given of the evolution of the spread during
   typical matches and theoretical predictions are shown to compare closely
   to spreads quoted by online bookmakers during some of the important
   matches of the EURO2004 tournament. Journal of the Operational Research

   2002/03 combining sport and financial variables. The paper evaluates how
   close the clubs are relative to the frontier of best practices,
   analysing how they manage sport as well as financial results. Managerial
   implications of the research are devised.}},

Abstract = {{The paper investigates the selection of accounting policies for
   intangible assets in the Italian football industry, focusing on the
   effects of the so-called salva calcio decree. Introduced by the Italian
   government, the decree effectively permitted clubs to amortize the asset
   of players' registration rights over an arbitrary time period of 10
   years rather than over the length of players' contracts, thus improving
   clubs' reported financial position and performance. While adoption of
   the salva calcio decree had no direct cash flow effect, it had indirect
   economic consequences. It is argued that adoption of this policy by some
   Italian clubs was motivated by a form of legitimacy theory, whereby
   clubs sought to legitimize their financial position and performance with
   a view to meeting the licensing demands of football governing bodies. It
   also highlights the difficulty stakeholders face when trying to
   understand a football club's financial results. Far from being neutral,
   figures in financial statements are value-laden.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decade there has been a proliferation of sports stadia
   being built in America's municipal districts. While it used to be common
   for the public to fully fund stadium construction projects, over the
   past 20 years factors such as political motives, tax reform, and
   increased public awareness of tax equity have forced sports teams to
   share increasing amounts of the financial burden (Crompton, Howard, \&
   Var, 2003). As public funding for stadia construction has decreased,
   franchises have continued to strive for maximized profits. Concurrently,
   the cost of attending events in sports stadia has increased for
   consumers in terms of higher ticket prices even though changes in fixed
   costs should not affect pricing (Leeds \& von Allmen, 2004).
   The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the
   use of public funds to build stadia and the profit maximizing goals of
   National Football League (NFL) franchises. A hypothesis was formulated
   that stated the impact of the public share of the construction cost
   would have no effect on relative ticket prices for those that consume
   the product. The cross-sectional data for a ticket price model, which
   consisted of seasonal data from every NFL team to play from 1991 through
   2003, was investigated. The results showed an increase in public funding
   by 10\% lowers ticket prices by 42 cents. As shown, the bulk of the
   variation in ticket prices was due to a general increase over time and
   MSA per capita income.}},

Abstract = {{Do big-time college sports affect state appropriations to public
   colleges and universities? Little attention has been given to the
   possibility that big-time athletic programs generate economic benefits
   for a university at the state capital. The paper estimates a reduced
   form model of the determination of annual state appropriations to public
   universities, including institution-specific effects to control for
   unobservable factors like mission and reputation that could affect
   appropriations. The results suggest that institutions fielding Division
   I-A football programs receive 8\% more in annual state appropriations -
   about \$2.6 million in real 1982 dollars - than those without such
   programs. Bowl appearances and national rankings do not lead to
   additional appropriations. These results suggest that the total economic
   benefit associated with big-time athletic programs may be larger than
   previously thought and provide insight into why the number of
   institutions fielding Division I-A college football programs increased
   by 10\% from 1998 to 2002.}},

Abstract = {{Acceleration is an important factor for success in team-sport athletes.
   The purpose of this investigation was to compare the reliability of 10-m
   sprint times when using different starting techniques. Junior male rugby
   players (n=15) were tested for speed over 10 m on 2 different testing
   sessions. Three trials of 3 different starting techniques (standing,
   foot, and thumb starts) were assessed. Despite large differences in the
   time taken to perform 10-m sprints from different starts, there was
   minimal difference in the typical error (similar to 0.02 seconds, or
   <1\%) between the 3 different starts. There was a small, 0.02 +/- 0.02
   second, decrease (p=0.05) in sprint time between sessions for the foot
   start. For all starting techniques, the magnitude of error (typical
   error) was greater than the smallest worthwhile change (<0.01 second),
   indicating that acceleration over 10 m measured by photocells only has a
   marginal chance of reliably detecting a change of sufficient magnitude
   to be worthwhile in practical terms. However, by accounting for the
   smallest worthwhile change and typical error, it is possible to
   establish the probability an individual has had a worthwhile change in
   sprint performance. Coaching and sports-science practitioners can use a
   variety of sprint-start techniques shown to have small typical errors
   (<1\%); however, the results from the different starting technique are
   not interchangeable.}},

Abstract = {{Following recent increases in the financial value of sport sponsorship
   programs, some commentators believe this has been accompanied by the
   development of sponsorship management practices. Despite this, there are
   still widespread concerns about some of these practices. This study
   therefore sets out to examine and comment upon the practice of
   sponsorship management from an English perspective, specifically in
   soccer. This is an area of sponsorship that has previously been examined
   and is a sport in which there have been significant commercial
   developments in recent years. Using face-to-face interviews and
   questionnaires, 43 corporations provided information about their
   sponsorship programs. While there is some evidence of good practice, a
   continuing failure to effectively manage sport sponsorship programs is
   clear. The study thus concludes by making recommendations about the
   future development of sport sponsorship management.}},

Abstract = {{Sets of odds issued by bookmakers may be interpreted as incorporating
   implicit probabilistic forecasts of sporting events. Employing a sample
   of nearly 10000 English football (soccer) games, we compare the
   effectiveness of forecasts based on published odds and forecasts made
   using a benchmark statistical model incorporating a large number of
   quantifiable variables relevant to match outcomes. The experts' views,
   represented by the published odds, are shown to be increasingly
   effective over a 5-year period. Bootstraps performed on the statistical
   model fail to outperform the expert judges. The trend towards
   odds-setters displaying greater expertise as forecasters coincided with
   a period during which intensifying competition is likely to have
   increased the financial penalties for bookmakers of imprecise
   odds-setting. In the context of a financially pressured environment, the
   main findings of this paper challenge the consensus that subjective
   forecasting by experts will normally be inferior to forecasts from
   statistical models. (c) 2005 International Institute of Forecasters.

Abstract = {{A significant proportion of nutritional supplements manufactured
   worldwide contain non-listed contaminations with anabolic-androgenic
   steroids (AAS), whose ingestion may lead to positive doping test
   results. This will lead to the suspension of, and sanctions against, the
   athlete, since this group of active substances is prohibited by the
   anti-doping code of the World Anti-Doping Agency as well as by sports
   associations not connected with this agency. Considerable financial
   losses are often the consequence for a banned athlete. Based on an
   amendment to the law governing the manufacture and prescription of drugs
   (AMG) in Germany in 1997 and an increasingly extensive interpretation of
   the term ``drug{''} by the Federal Supreme Court, preparations
   containing anabolic steroids or their precursors are to be classified as
   drugs and, therefore, are subject to compulsory declaration as stated by
   the AMG. If this obligation is not adhered to, the result may be a claim
   for damages by the athlete against the manufacturer of a preparation, if
   the athlete took the preparation thinking it was harmless as judged by
   the Anti-Doping regulations, but was then found to be positive in doping
   tests. The judges in the first case before the county court in Stuttgart
   decided in favour of the claim for damages with respect to lost bonuses,
   loss of earnings and accrued legal costs by a soccer player who tested
   positive and was therefore suspended. Based on the evidence presented,
   the court came to the decision that the soccer player's positive test
   result was due to the ingestion of nutritional supplements containing
   non-listed AAS. This procedure could set a precedent for other states to
   demonstrate that athletes who had tested positive due to contaminated
   nutritional supplements are not without legal protection.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To examine the activity profile and physical loading of elite
   female soccer players during match play and to study the relationship
   between training status and physical match performance. Methods:
   Time-motion analysis and HR recordings were performed on 14 elite female
   soccer players during competitive matches. In addition, the players
   carried out a laboratory treadmill test and the Yo-Yo intermittent
   recovery test. Results: The total distance covered during a game was
   10.3 km (range: 9.7-11.3) with high-intensity running (HIR) accounting
   for 1.31 km (0.71-1.70). HIR was performed 125 times (72-159) for 2.3 s
   (2.0-2.4) on average. The average and peak HR in a game were 167 beats
   per minute (bpm) (152-186) and 186 (171-205), respectively,
   corresponding to 87\% (81-93) and 97\% (96-100) of HRmax. Maximal
   pulmonary oxygen uptake ((V) over dot O-2max) was 49.4 mL center dot
   min(-1)center dot kg(-1) (43.4-56.8), and incremental treadmill test
   (ITT) performance was 4.49 min (3.38-5.17). The Yo-Yo test performance
   was 1379 m (600-1960). The total distance covered during match play did
   not correlate with (V) over dot O-2max or ITT performance but correlated
   with the Yo-Yo test result (r = 0.56, P < 0.05). Significant positive
   correlations were observed between HIR and (V) over dot O-2max (r =
   0.81, P < 0.05), ITT (r = 0.82, P < 0.05), and Yo-Yo test performance (r
   = 0.76, P < 0.05). No relationship was observed between \%HRmax during
   match play and any of the performance measures. Conclusion: The present
   study demonstrated that 1) HIR during games varies markedly between
   elite female soccer players, 2) all players have high HR throughout a
   competitive game with periods of near-maximal values, 3) the distance
   covered by HIR during match play is closely related to the physical
   capacity, and 4) the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test can be used as an
   indicator of the physical match performance of elite female players.}},

Abstract = {{FRS 10 requires investments in player contracts by football companies to
   be capitalized and amortized. Given the high degree of uncertainty
   associated with such contracts, it is not clear that this treatment is
   consistent with asset capitalization criteria. The evidence provided in
   this paper does not support inconclusively this capitalization
   requirement in that it indicates weak association of investment in
   player contracts with three measures of future benefits. In particular,
   the duration of this association is at most two years, which is shorter
   than the duration implied by the amortization period reported by sample
   companies. Nonetheless, other findings suggest that market participants
   seem to agree with the treatment prescribed by FRS 10. These results
   should be of interest to practitioner and standard setters who
   (axiomatically) regard intangibles acquired in an arm's length
   transaction as assets.}},

Abstract = {{The resource-based view explains sustainable competitive advantage as
   the consequence of an organization's endowment of unique and imperfectly
   replicable resources. Superior organizational performance, however,
   depends not only on the organization's resource endowment but also on
   the efficiency with which the resource endowment is used. In this
   article a resource-utilization model of a professional sports team is
   developed in which teams optimize the stock of athletic resources (i.e.,
   playing talent), subject to ownership preferences, over sporting and
   financial performance. The resource-utilization model is used to analyze
   the factors influencing the team's current endowment of athletic
   resources and evaluate the efficiency with which teams utilize both
   their athletic and allegiance (i.e., fan base) resources to achieve
   sporting and financial targets. Empirical evidence is presented on the
   sporting and financial performance of English professional soccer teams
   in the FA Premier League over the period 1998-2002. It was found that
   the financial performance of teams is significantly affected by their
   ownership status.}},

Abstract = {{Success in sport can provide a source of national pride for a society,
   and vast financial and personal rewards for an individual athlete. It is
   therefore not surprising that many athletes will go to great lengths in
   pursuit of success. The provision of healthcare for elite sports people
   has the potential to create many ethical issues for sports doctors;
   however there has been little discussion of them to date. This study
   highlights these issues. Respondents to a questionnaire identified many
   ethical matters, common to other areas of medicine. However they also
   raised problems unique to sports medicine. Some of these ethical
   difficulties arise out of the place of the sports doctor within the
   hierarchy of sport. Yet others arise out of the special relationship
   between sports doctors and individual players/athletes. This study
   raises some important questions regarding the governance of healthcare
   in sport, and what support and guidance is available to sports doctors.
   As medical and scientific intervention in sport escalates, there is a
   risk that demands for enhanced performance may compromise the health of
   the athlete, and the role the sports doctor plays remains a critical
   question.}},

Abstract = {{Drawing upon the work of Pierre Bourdieu, this article illustrates how a
   group of young, predominantly working-class men come to possess a doxic
   knowledge of the value of the game of football and its stakes. Drawing
   on a survey of Scottish football players, the article concludes that
   young participants are guided from an early age toward sporting careers
   that, although offering the hope of transcending their objective
   conditions, invariably deceive them with optimism. In the perilous
   financial climate facing the Scottish professional game, players are
   being discarded bereft of the exchangeable, readily transferable skills
   necessary for a future in an alternative employment field. Overreliant
   upon a constantly depreciating bank of physical capital, these players
   face precarious futures once this asset reaches exhaustion and their
   working bodies are deemed surplus to requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Events have become a significant component of destination marketing.
   Previous work suggests that event interest, risk constraint, and
   financial constraint will affect potential attendees' desire to attend
   and their sense that it is feasible to attend. For large sport events,
   interest in the event and perceived constraints should derive from the
   level of fan motives, travel motivations, and the potential attendee's
   background. These expectations are tested in a survey of 556 members of
   American soccer clubs prior to the FIFA World Cup. Results were
   generally consistent with expectations, although some motives had both
   positive and negative effects. Event interest and constraints fully
   mediated the effects of motives and background on respondents' sense
   that it was feasible for them to attend. Financial constraint did not
   affect desire to attend. The desire to learn about the host country had
   direct effects on interest in the event and the desire to attend the
   event. Results suggest the value of segmented sport event marketing that
   appeals to both travel and fan motives. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to examine knowledge and perceptions of
   applied sport psychology within English soccer. National coaches ( n =
   8), youth academy directors ( n = 21) and academy coaches ( n = 27) were
   surveyed using questionnaire and interview methods. Questionnaire
   results revealed a lack of knowledge of sport psychology that appeared
   to underpin some of the most significant barriers to entry for sport
   psychologists. These included lack of clarity concerning the services of
   a sport psychologist, problems fitting in and players' negative
   perceptions of sport psychology. Overall, however, lack of finance was
   the highest rated barrier. Six barrier dimensions emerged from the
   interview data: negative perceptions of psychology, lack of sport
   psychology knowledge, integrating with players and coaching staff, role
   and service clarity, practical constraints, and perceived value of sport
   psychology. These findings were broadly compatible with the survey data,
   with finance emerging as a major barrier and misconceptions of sport
   psychology being common. Our conclusions are discussed in relation to
   the practical implications of the study for both applied research and
   the provision of sport psychology services within English soccer.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To estimate the overall incidence of acute and overuse
   volleyball injuries, and to describe factors associated with ankle
   sprains.
   Methods: 486 players from the second and third Dutch national volleyball
   divisions participated in the study and were followed prospectively
   during a whole season. Three measurements were made during the season (
   baseline, follow up 1, and follow up 2), where all players completed a
   questionnaire on demographic variables ( only at baseline), sports
   participation, use of preventive measures, and previous injuries.
   Volleyball exposure during training and matches was recorded for each
   individual player by the coach on a weekly exposure form. In case of
   injury the coach provided the injured player with an injury registration
   form, which had to be completed within one week after the onset of
   injury.
   Results: 100 injuries were reported, resulting in an overall injury
   incidence of 2.6 injuries/1000 hours. The incidence of acute injuries
   was 2.0/1000 hours. Ankle sprains ( n = 41) accounted for most of the
   acute injuries, and 31 (75\%) of all players with an ankle sprain
   reported a previous ankle sprain. Twenty five overuse injuries were
   reported. The overall incidence of overuse injuries was 0.6/1000 hours;
   the back and the shoulder were the most common sites.
   Conclusions: Ankle sprain is the most common injury in volleyball,
   accounting for 41\% of all volleyball related injuries. Previous injury
   seems to be an important risk factor for an ankle sprain. Injury
   prevention programmes should focus on ankle sprains and concentrate on
   players with previous ankle sprains.}},

Abstract = {{The North American model of resource allocation in professional sports
   leagues is adapted for English (association) football. Comparisons are
   drawn between the equilibrium allocations of playing talent under
   objective functions of profit maximisation and win percent maximisation
   subject to a financial constraint. Empirical revenue functions are
   reported for 1926-1999. These indicate a shift in the composition of
   demand favouring big-city teams and an increase in the sensitivity of
   revenue to performance. An analysis of match results in the FA Cup
   suggests an increase in competitive imbalance between teams at different
   levels of the league's divisional hierarchy, as the theory suggests.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, I review the major arguments in John Searle's 1995 book,
   The Construction of Social Reality, and use them as the basis for
   exploring the relationship between economic reality and financial
   accounting numbers. In this book, Searle provides the tools to analyze
   factual type representations in terms of objective and subjective with
   respect to both their ontological status and their epistemological
   status. Using these tools, I demonstrate that many financial accounting
   representations may be properly characterized as epistemologically
   objective facts, even though they have an ontologically subjective mode
   of existence. Other financial accounting representations, however, only
   come into existence in accordance with a set of rules, financial
   accounting rules, that have no objective basis in either physical or
   institutional reality. The financial accounting rules for aggregating
   the monetary amount of total assets, for calculating net assets, net
   income and earnings per share are more akin to the rules for a game such
   as football. Once the rules have been established, certain
   representations based on those rules may be said to be epistemologically
   objective with respect to those rules, even though there is no objective
   basis for the rules themselves. This does not, however, render financial
   accounting representations useless. In fact, I argue that
   representations of net income and owners equity are useful because, like
   economic price indices and other such indicators, they are fuzzy
   indicators of wealth and changes in wealth. As such, they are not
   foolproof representations. Depending upon the rules, such indicators may
   be constructed in ways that are more or less reliable, or more or less
   misleading with respect to the objectives of users. Indeed, from this
   perspective, the job of standard-setting bodies, such as the FASB, can
   be characterized in terms of continually amending the rules in an effort
   to keep ``the game{''} within the bounds of acceptable perceptions of
   reality. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the relationship between player compensation in
   college football and competitive balance on the field. It shows that
   National Collegiate Athletic Association rule changes restricting
   football-player compensation are not associated with an improvement in
   football's competitive balance. Although college football is marginally
   more balanced than professional sports in any given year, an examination
   of cumulative records spanning numerous seasons proves college football
   to be as unbalanced as professional sports. The movement toward reducing
   player compensation, coincident with an increasing value to player
   talent, raises issues over how the financial gain from college football
   talent should be used. The significant degree of talent (and financial)
   imbalance among college football teams suggests that more attention
   should be paid to the determinants of talent distribution in college
   football.}},

Abstract = {{The market for sports gambling is structured very differently from the
   typical financial market. In sports betting, bookmakers announce a
   price, after which adjustments are small and infrequent. Bookmakers do
   not play the traditional role of market makers matching buyers and
   sellers but, rather, take large positions with respect to the outcome of
   game. Using a unique data set, I demonstrate that this peculiar
   price-setting mechanism allows bookmakers to achieve substantially
   higher profits. Bookmakers are wore skilled at predicting the outcomes
   of games than bettors and systematically exploit bettor biases by
   choosing prices that deviate from the market clearing price.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term development of injury risk in Swedish male elite football
   was studied. Two prospective cohort studies from seasons 1982 and 2001
   were compared with respect to exposure to football, injury incidence and
   injury severity.
   The mean number of training sessions during the season had increased by
   68\% between 1982 and 2001 (142 vs. 238, P<0.001), whereas teams played
   more matches in 1982 (49 vs. 41, P=0.02). The total exposure to football
   had increased by 27\%. Three out of four players incurred an injury in
   both seasons. In 2001, players suffered more training injuries due to an
   increased training exposure. Accounting for risk exposure, there was no
   difference in injury incidence or severity between the two seasons. The
   incidence was 8.3 injuries/ 1000 h of total exposure (4.6 in training
   and 20.6 in matches) in 1982, compared to 7.8 1000 h(-1) (5.2 in
   training and 25.9 in matches) in 2001. Major injuries accounted for 9\%
   of all injuries, corresponding to an incidence of 0.8 /1000 h of
   football, in both seasons.
   A trend from semi-professionalism to full professionalism in Swedish
   elite football was seen during the last two decades. The injury risk did
   not change over the same period.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To quantify and describe medically treated sport and active
   recreation injuries in a defined region of the Latrobe Valley from 7
   November 1994 to 6 November 1995.
   Method: A geographic target area was defined, restricted to the six
   postcodes that fell wholly within the catchment area of the Latrobe
   Regional Hospital. Data describing medically treated sport and active
   recreation injuries to Latrobe Valley residents aged over 4 years (about
   70000) were selected by postcode from three sources: the Victorian
   Admitted Episodes Dataset (hospital admissions), the Victorian Injury
   Surveillance System (presentations to hospital emergency departments),
   and the Extended Latrobe Valley Injury Surveillance (ELVIS) project
   (presentations to general practitioners).
   Results: At least 2300 cases of medically treated sport and active
   recreation injury were recorded. This corresponds to a hospital
   admission rate of 16/10000 population, emergency department presentation
   rate of 169/10000 population, and a general practitioner presentation
   rate of 187/10000 population. There were more male patients than female,
   and younger age groups were also overrepresented, but these data may
   reflect the greater participation of these groups in sport and active
   recreation. Australian football was associated with the highest number
   of injuries (accounting for 24.0\% and 22.0\% of presentations to
   emergency departments and general practitioners respectively) followed
   by cycling (15.7\% and 12.6\%) and basketball (17.5\% and 13.5\%).
   Conclusions: This study shows that routine health sector data
   collections in defined populations can provide useful information on the
   size, distribution, and characteristics of the problem of sport and
   active recreation injuries at the community level. However, all current
   health sector systems for injury data collection and surveillance
   require attention to improve case capture and identification and data
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the incidence of attendance, type of injury, sport
   involved and management of sports injuries in children attending an
   Accident \& Emergency (A \& E) department. Method: Children, aged
   between 5-16 years, presenting with an injury related to sport, were
   studied over a period of three months. Results: 1858 children attended
   the A \& E department during the three month period. 238 ( 12.8\%) were
   classified as sports injuries. Boys (71 \%) were injured more frequently
   than girls (29\%). injury rates in boys peaked at 14 years whereas in
   girls a peak occurred earlier at 12 years. Football was the most common
   sport implicated in injuries (39\%). Rollerblading (14\%), Rugby (8\%),
   Basketball (7\%) and Physical Education at school (7\%) were the next
   most frequently involved sports. Soft tissue injuries dominated (61 \%).
   The upper limb was the most common ;anatomical area injured (46\%).
   Other injuries involved the lower limb (36\%), bead and neck (15\%) and
   the trunk (3 \%). Injuries to the wrist were the most frequent
   presentation accounting for 30 fractures and 30 soft tissue injuries
   (25\%). The majority of children were discharged from the A \& E
   department after treatment (71 \%). 26\% were reviewed at out-patient
   clinics and 3 \% required hospital admission. No children were referred
   for physiotherapy. Conclusion: Children participate in sport and can be
   injured. The majority of sports injuries presenting to an A \& E
   department appear to be of a minor nature and could be managed with
   simple first aid techniques by parents, teachers and coaches at the
   scene or by attending primary care in the first instance. Supervision of
   children, participation in organised sport and the use of protection
   devices may help to prevent serious injury.}},

Abstract = {{The progress of injury prevention research in Australian football to
   date has been slow despite its recognition as a public health goal. In
   particular, field-based studies to identify injury risk factors and
   evaluate the effectiveness of injury prevention strategies need to be
   undertaken to ensure safety gains in this sport. For these types of
   studies to be successful and complied with, considerable support is
   required from clubs, coaches and players. To date, the actual level of
   support for injury prevention research at the community-level of
   football has not been established.
   A survey of 82 club administrators and coaches from the Victorian
   Amateur Football Association was undertaken to determine the level of
   support for injury prevention research, along with incentives for, and
   barriers towards, participation in such research. The highest priorities
   for injury prevention research were given as the prevention of knee,
   hamstring and concussion injuries and investigation into the content of
   training programs. The most common incentives reported as being
   necessary for participation in injury prevention research were financial
   assistance (59.5\%), more club staff (57.0\%) and further education
   (36.7\%). The most commonly reported barriers to research were the
   expertise (50.0\%) and number of (48.8\%) of club medical staff members.
   Overall community-level football club administrators and coaches rank
   the importance of injury prevention research highly. The findings of
   this study are positive for injury prevention researchers and suggest
   that clubs are keen to participate in such research.}},

Abstract = {{A prospective study of soccer injuries, involving 287 male youth
   players, from the ages of 12-15 was conducted in 24 Greek soccer clubs,
   during the course of one year. A total of 193 players sustained 209
   injuries. The incidence of injuries was 4.0 injuries per 1000 h of
   soccer time per player, and the most common types of injuries were
   sprains and strains. Surprisingly, it was found that an increase of
   injury incidences occurred during practice. Fifty-eight injuries
   required medical assistance. The majority of injuries (80\%) were
   located in the lower extremities. Collision with other players was the
   most common activity at the time of injury, accounting for 40\% of all
   injuries. The conclusion of this study and the evidence from other
   studies suggests that youth soccer is a relatively low risk sport.
   However, a substantial amount of injuries could be prevented. It is
   necessary to identify the risk factors, which are associated with these
   types of injuries .}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this epidemiologic study is twofold: first, to
   determine the relative frequency of sports-related injuries compared
   with all musculoskeletal injuries in patients 5 to 21 years of age
   presenting to the emergency department (ED), and second, to evaluate the
   sports-specific and anatomic site-specific nature of these injuries.
   Methods: Patterns of injury in patients 5 to 21 years of age presenting
   to four pediatric EDs with musculoskeletal injuries in October 1999 and
   April 2000 were prospectively studied. Information collected included
   age, sex, injury type, anatomical injury site, and cause of injury
   (sports-related or otherwise). Information about patient outcome and
   disposition was also obtained.
   Results: There were a total of 1421 injuries in 1275 patients.
   Musculoskeletal injuries were more common in male patients (790/62\%)
   than in female patients. The mean age of the patients was 12.2 years
   (95\% CI, 12.0-12.4). Sprains, contusions, and fractures were the most
   common injury types (34, 30, and 25\%, respectively). Female patients
   experienced a greater percentage of sprains (44\% vs 36\%) and
   contusions (37\% vs 33\%) and fewer fractures (22\% vs 31\%) than male
   patients. Sports injuries accounted for 41\% (521) of all
   musculoskeletal injuries and were responsible for 8\% (495/6173) of all
   ED visits. Head, forearm, and wrist injuries were most commonly seen in
   biking, hand injuries in football and basketball, knee injuries in
   soccer, and ankle and foot injuries in basketball.
   Conclusions: Sports injuries in children and adolescents were by far the
   most common cause of musculoskeletal injuries treated in the ED,
   accounting for 41\% of all musculoskeletal injuries. This represents the
   highest percentage of sports-related musculoskeletal injuries per ED
   visit reported in children to date. As children and adolescents
   participate in sports in record numbers nationwide, sports injury
   research and prevention will become increasingly more important.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The risk of major renal injury resulting from various forms of
   sports participation is unknown. Urologists often recommend that
   children with a solitary kidney avoid contact sports. We reviewed our
   recent experience with pediatric renal trauma to determine if there is
   an association between different types of sports activity and high grade
   renal injury.
   Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records
   of 68 consecutive children with blunt renal injury who were treated at 2
   level I trauma centers. Injuries were graded using the renal injury
   scale of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma. Records
   were reviewed for mechanism of injury, associated injuries, management
   and injury severity score. Statistical analysis was performed using
   Fisher's exact test or Wilcoxon rank sum test.
   Results: Of the 68 renal lesions 13 were grade 1, 15 grade 11, 15 grade
   111, 17 grade IV and 8 grade V. The most common cause of renal trauma
   was motor vehicle accidents, accounting for 21 injuries (30.1\%).
   Accidents associated with nonmotorized sports activity accounted for 14
   injuries (20.6\%). Bicycle riding was the most common sports etiology,
   accounting for 8 of 14 cases (57.1\%) at an age range of 5 to 15 years
   (mean 9.4). None of the bicycle injuries involved collision with a motor
   vehicle. Bicycling accounted for 1 grade 1, 1 grade 11, 1 grade 111, 2
   grade IV and 3 grade V injuries. Football, hockey and sledding were
   responsible for the remaining 6 sports related injuries. High grade
   renal injury (grade IV or V) was identified in 5 of 8 bicycle accidents
   (62.5\%) and 1 of 6 nonbicycle sports related injuries (16.7\%, p =
   0.14). Injury severity scores ranged from 4 to 50 (mean 20.6) for
   bicycle renal injuries and 4 to 13 (mean 6.7) for nonbicycle sports
   related trauma (p <0.05). Parents indicated that blunt trauma from the
   handlebars was the major factor contributing to renal injury in 3
   bicycle cases. Renal trauma from bicycle riding resulted in 1
   nephrectomy.
   Conclusions: Bicycle riding is the most common sports related cause of
   renal injury in children and is associated with a significant risk of
   major renal injury. Families of children with a solitary kidney should
   be aware of this risk factor. Team contact sports are an uncommon cause
   of high grade renal injury. Current recommendations regarding sports
   participation by children with a solitary kidney need to be reevaluated.}},

Abstract = {{The bowl-championship-series (BCS) committee uses 10 ranking schemes,
   including eight computer rankings, to select college football teams for
   bowl-championship-series bowl games, including the national championship
   game. The large financial benefits of participating in BCS bowl games
   make it imperative that the selection process accurately select the best
   teams. I evaluated the performance of the 10 ranking schemes the BCS
   committee used during the 1999 and 2000 seasons to select bowl teams. I
   found that almost all are equally accurate, but the Seattle Times scheme
   clearly underperforms the others. In addition, two proposed changes to
   the BCS selection formula, (1) to prohibit computer ranking schemes from
   considering the margin of victory in their rankings, and (2) to include
   explicitly the outcomes of head-to-head games among teams being
   considered for BCS bowls, could do more harm than good and could
   decrease the likelihood of the committee selecting the best teams for
   the BCS bowls.}},

Abstract = {{The process of risk management, which is used throughout industry and
   commerce, involves identifying work activities and hazards and
   estimating, evaluating and controlling the associated risks. Within
   professional football, injury rates are several orders of magnitude
   higher than those reported in other occupations. This sector, therefore.
   provides an ideal organisational setting for developing and testing
   theories of health and safety management. A major risk for clubs arises
   from players being unavailable for selection through injury, with the
   possible effect that this may have on the clubs' playing and financial
   performances. A statistically based risk management model,which utilised
   four relationships involving the parameters of team-quality,
   team-performance, club-turnover and club-salary, was developed. The
   model was based on data from 91 league clubs in English professional
   football over the seasons 1993/1994-1997/1998. Significant (P<0,01)
   strong (1-0.80-0.97) correlations were obtained for four log-log
   relationships between the four parameters. The model, which incorporated
   a player quality variable, has been demonstrated to describe and assess
   the impact of players' injuries on clubs' playing and financial
   performances. It is proposed that the model could therefore be used as a
   basis for cost-benefit analyses of injury prevention strategies in
   professional football. The results presented support earlier reports,
   which describe the impact of accidents to employees on the financial
   performance of their employers. Similar economic frameworks may also be
   applicable within other organisational settings for assessing the costs
   of accidents and for use in cost benefit analyses. (C) 2001 Published by

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: No previous studies on mandibular fracture patterns in
   Tasmania, and very few elsewhere in Australia, have undertaken to
   discover which identified age, gender, aetiology, anatomical location of
   the fracture, period of injury, whether alcohol consumption was
   associated with the injury, and treatment of mandibular fractures.
   Method: A retrospective study was undertaken of 251 patients with
   fractured mandibles presenting to the Royal Hobart Hospital, Tasmania
   from 1993-1999. Data were obtained from the Oral and Maxillofacial
   Surgery unit fracture record books cross-checked with patients,
   impatient/outpatient hospital records.
   Results: The male to female ratio was 4.5:1, with mandibular fractures
   most common in the male age group of 21-30 years. Assaults (55 per cent
   of all patients) were the major cause of fractures. Males accounted for
   855 per cent of assaults, with punching being the most common method,
   followed by motor vehicle accidents (MVA), 18.3 per cent and sport, 16.7
   per cent. In sport, Australian Rules Football was the most common cause,
   accounting for 45.2 per cent of sporting injuries. The site most
   frequently fractured was the angle of the mandible. Alcohol abuse was
   seen in 41.4 per cent of the patients with 84.6 per cent being male.
   Open reduction and internal fixation with miniplate osteosynthesis, was
   the preferred treatment modality. The results are compared with other
   series.
   Conclusions: Mandibular fractures are common,in Tasmania, with the
   highest rates involved in assaults and sport (especially Australian
   Rules Football) and a low rate in MVA. These fractures commonly occurred
   in young males in which assaults, alcohol and social issues were
   associated. Therefore, preventive measures and strong public awareness
   addressing this group may be of benefit in reducing the rate of assaults
   and sporting injuries to the mandible.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the views of retired players about the provision
   of support services in English professional soccer before and after
   retirement and to assess the impact of career ending injury on these
   views.
   Method: An anonymous self administered questionnaire was distributed to
   500 former players registered with the English Professional Footballers'
   Association. The questions asked about personal details, current medical
   status, reasons for retirement, perceptions of the provision and quality
   of support services, and use of prophylactic treatments while injured.
   Results: Of the 500 questionnaires distributed, 185 (37\%) were
   returned. The Professional Footballers' Association provided
   significantly (p<0.001) more help and advice to retired players on
   medical, financial, career, and educational matters than any other
   organisation. Although respondents showed some satisfaction with the
   provision of medical support, they were significantly (p<0.001) less
   satisfied with the provision of sports science (23\%) and
   education/welfare (19\%) support. Respondents who had retired through
   injury, however, were more dissatisfied with the provision of all
   services. Significantly (p<0.001) more respondents agreed with the view
   that injuries would reduce income earning potential, contribute to
   medical problems, and restrict the duration of their playing career.
   Respondents who had been medically diagnosed with osteoarthritis were
   significantly more likely, at some time, to have regularly received
   steroid injections while injured.
   Conclusion: The results presented are consistent with other evidence
   that the provision of injury prevention and socioeconomic services at
   professional soccer clubs is inadequate. The soccer industry should
   therefore develop a long term strategy for managing the needs of players
   who are forced to retire through injury.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: A 5-year retrospective injury survey was conducted with 45
   female elite soccer players from the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS),
   to record the anatomical distribution, diagnosis and incidence of injury
   and identify possible risk factors in elite female soccer players at the
   QAS from 1993-1998. Methods: Data were gathered from medical,
   physiological, coaches and team managers' records. Results: The study
   recorded 239 injuries. incidence of injury was highest in 1994 (12.2 per
   1000 h) and lowest in 1995 (5.0 per 1000 h). Athletic exposure almost
   doubled between 1994 and 1995. Incidence of injury per 1000 athletic
   exposure hours decreased from 12.2 to 5 between 1994 and 1995. The leg
   accounted for 81.5\% of all injuries and 52\% of injuries involved the
   foot, ankle and shin. Strains (35\%) and sprains (31\%) were the most
   common diagnoses. Most injuries were of a mild nature (61\%), with major
   injuries accounting for 19\% of total injuries over the period
   1993-1998. The most common major injuries were stress fractures (29\%),
   with tibial stress fractures being the most common type. Injuries to the
   ankle, shin or both these areas were sustained by 66\% of players.
   Seventy-six percent of ankle injuries and 100\% of shin injuries were
   recurrent. Twenty-two percent of players had both ankle and shin
   injuries, in 90\% of cases ankle injury was sustained before the shin
   injury. Conclusions: Ankle and shin were the most common injury in this
   group of high performance female soccer players with high recurrence.
   Incidence of injury may be related to athletic exposure. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Problem: Stakeholders have different reasons for their interest in the
   regulation of motor racing. These reasons include the provision of, for
   example, safety for drivers, excitement for spectators, financial
   success for racing teams, and a positive environment for sponsors'
   products and services. The acceptability/unacceptability of current risk
   levels in motor racing depends on these stakeholders' perceptions of
   risk, within the sport. Method: This study assessed the risk perceptions
   and preferences of stakeholders through the use of structured
   interviews. Comparative data on fatal accident rates (FARs) in sport
   were obtained from published data. The number and type of vehicle
   incidents during competition were obtained from the circuit marshals'
   incident reports and post-race vehicle damage was assessed by visual
   inspection. Discussion: Two hundred and three stakeholders, defined as
   spectators (49), race officials (69), race teams (63), and safety
   managers (22) were interviewed during open-wheel and closed-wheel motor
   racing competitions. Significant differences (P < .05) were observed
   between stakeholders for the relative risk perception scores across five
   sports; however, their rank ordering of the relative risk perception
   scores were similar and consistent with FARs for these sports.
   Spectators demonstrated a reverse affiliation bias effect by overstating
   the relative risks of motor racing, compared to other stakeholders. All
   stakeholders perceived the relative risks associated with open-wheel
   racing to be significantly greater than closed-wheel racing and the
   relative risks associated with standing race starts to be significantly
   greater than rolling race starts. However, all stakeholders demonstrated
   a domain effect, and spectators and race officials also demonstrated
   cognitive dissonance, in their expressed preferences for the type of
   motor race starts. Nineteen of the 21 race team managers nominated just
   three motor racing circuits and 17 learn managers nominated
   ``run-off{''} or ``drop-off{''} track features as presenting the
   greatest risk to drivers. Impact on industry: The results obtained
   confirm the complexities faced by governing bodies, when setting
   acceptable levels of risk within professional sports regulations. (C)

   changing, it is often convenient to assume the data follow a non-linear
   state-space model. Typical paired comparison state-space models that
   assume a fixed (unknown) autoregressive variance do not account for the
   possibility of sudden changes in the merits. This is a particular
   concern, for example, in modeling cognitive ability in human
   development; cognitive ability not only changes over time, but also can
   change abruptly. We explore a particular extension of conventional
   state-space models for paired comparison data that allows the state
   variance to vary stochastically. Models of this type have recently been
   developed and applied to modeling financial data, but can be seen to
   have applicability in modeling paired comparison data. A filtering
   algorithm is also derived that can be used in place of likelihood-based
   computations when the number of objects being compared is large.
   Applications to National Football League game outcomes and chess game
   outcomes are presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the relationship between financial inequality,
   competitive balance and attendance at English professional league
   soccer. It shows that while financial inequality among the clubs has
   increased, competitive balance has remained relatively stable and match
   attendance appears unrelated to competitive balance. A clearer test
   of;he relationship is suggested by comparison with FA Cup matches.
   Because income inequality is primarily driven by inter- rather than
   intra-divisional inequality, the FA Cup has been a much more unbalanced
   competition than the divisional championships. Attendance at FA Cup
   matches relative to the corresponding league matches has fallen over the
   last twenty years.}},

Pages = {{1005-1012}},
Abstract = {{Since sports participation entails the risk of injuries that account for
   substantial morbidity and disability, the existence of adequate
   epidemiological information is essential for the development of sound
   preventive strategies. In this study, we present data on the occurrence
   of sports injuries among children in six European countries, namely
   Austria, Denmark, France, Greece, The Netherlands, and the United
   Kingdom. An operational definition for sports injuries was developed,
   and comparable data from the European Home and Leisure Accident
   Surveillance System, an established injury surveillance system operating
   in 12 European union countries, were collected from the participating
   member states, during a 1-year period (1998). Sports injuries were
   examined in schools, in organised and unorganised settings, and in
   specific types of sports by demographics and injury descriptive
   variables. Sports injuries represent a quantitatively important and
   sufficiently serious problem in European union countries, accounting for
   an estimated annual number of about a quarter of a million outpatient
   visits in two of the participating countries, which provide national
   estimates. It is evident, that sport injuries are not only common but
   also injuries of considerable severity, since a large fraction
   represents fractures, while approximately 4\% of the total require
   hospitalisation. Football and basketball among male children are, in
   declining order, the two sports responsible for the most frequent
   injuries in the European union countries, whereas gymnastics and
   volleyball prevail among females. The study indicates the importance of
   injury surveillance in describing the epidemiology of sports injuries
   and provides an estimate of the magnitude and the profile of sport
   injuries that take place annually in European union countries.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the authors examine the economic and policy implications
   of the National Football League (NFL) `blackout rule,' a league rule
   that prohibits local television broadcast of games that are not sold out
   at least 72 hours prior to game time. The foundation for understanding
   and assessing the impact of the blackout rule is an analysis of
   attendance using data on games during the 1996-1997 National Football
   League season. Expanding on previous research, three separate components
   of attendance (season ticket sales, game day ticket sales, and game day
   no-shows) are examined in detail. Accounting for the endogeneity of key
   variables, Tobit and Probit analyses are used to estimate and predict
   individual game attendance. These empirical estimates are then used as a
   vehicle to assess the implications of game day blackouts and the
   potential for public policy intervention. More specifically, the authors
   begin by estimating the impact of the blackout on game day attendance.
   Using these estimates, they assess the implications of imposing a local
   blackout for individual team revenues. The gain in on-site stadium
   revenue due to the blackout (e.g., through additional ticket and
   concession sales) are then viewed in the broader context of the societal
   loss due to the game not being broadcast in the local area. The
   empirical results suggest that the gain in team revenue is small in
   comparison to the loss of viewership rights. This suggests that public
   policy intervention may be possible that would result in a Pareto
   superior market outcome. The paper concludes by exploring possible
   intervention strategies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines data on the racial composition and financial and
   sporting performance of professional English soccer teams between 1974
   and 1993. In an earlier paper, Szymanski showed that teams with an above
   average proportion of black players would tend to perform better on
   average that would have been expected given the aggregate wage bills of
   these clubs. Since players are more or less freely traded in soccer this
   presents strong market-based evidence of discrimination. In the present
   paper we explore the source of such discrimination. In particular we are
   concerned to test the hypothesis that discrimination is attributable to
   the fans rather than the owners. If fans were racially prejuiced then
   the owners of a team might expect to generate a smaller marginal revenue
   product from a black player compared to an equally skilled white player.
   We assess the presence of fan discrimination by examining relationships
   between attendance, revenues, performance and the proportion of black
   players in the team. We also incorporate evidence regarding statements
   of racial prejudice (from the British Social Attitudes Survey) in
   particular regions. We find little evidence that the discrimination
   against black players has its source in fan discrimination.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides a review of the literature on sporting production
   functions with an emphasis on different input-output specifications and
   alternative estimation procedures. Empirical evidence is reported for
   English association football on the robustness of estimates of coaching
   efficiency to changes in estimation methods and the definition of team
   performance and playing talent inputs. A measure of player quality based
   on predicted start-of-season transfer values is developed. It is found
   that the estimation of coaching efficiency is sensitive to the choice of
   time-invariant efficiency models versus time-varying and inefficiency
   effects models. It is also found that the results are little affected by
   different measures of team performance but are highly sensitive to the
   use of an ex post financial expenditure input measure. Ex ante input
   measures based on start-of-season player characteristics or predicted
   transfer values are recommended as more appropriate on both theoretical
   and empirical grounds.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a framework of pro-social behaviour for
   understanding and explaining soccer fans' intentions to buy shares from
   their club in order to provide assistance in times of financial need.
   Based on the theory of norms, two alternative versions of the framework
   are empirically tested. Our results yield support for a mediating role
   of personal norms in the relationship between social norms and
   behavioural intentions. In other words, the social norm of reciprocity,
   as well as the level of individual attachment and the degree of
   perceived efficacy instigates fans to feel the personal obligation to
   provide financial support by means of buying soccer club shares.
   Alternatively, no support for moderating hypotheses was found. Perceived
   efficacy and individual attachment have no impact on the relationship
   between obligation and behavioural intentions of soccer fans. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Objective-To describe the trends in recreational sports injury in Perth,
   Western Australia.
   Design-A prospective cohort study of sports injuries during the 1997
   winter season (May to September). Setting-Sample of Australian football,
   field hockey, basketball, and netball players from the Perth
   metropolitan area, Western Australia.
   Methods-A cohort of sports participants was followed over the five month
   winter sports season. Before the season, participants completed a
   baseline questionnaire and during the season were interviewed every four
   weeks by telephone.
   Results-Overall, 92\% of participants (n = 1391) who completed a
   baseline questionnaire completed at least one follow up telephone
   interview. About half (51\%) of the cohort sustained one or more
   injuries during the winter season accounting for a total of 1034
   injuries. Most injuries were of moderate (58\%, n = 598) or minor (40\%,
   n = 412) severity, with only 3\% (n = 24) requiring emergency department
   treatment or a hospital stay. The injury incidence rate was greatest for
   football (20.3/1000 hours of participation), similar for field hockey
   and basketball (15.2/1000 hours and 15.1/1000 hours respectively), and
   lowest for netball (12.1/1000 hours). The incidence of injury was
   greatest in the first four weeks of the season, and participants aged
   between 26 and 30 years had about a 55\% greater risk of injury than
   those aged less than 18 years.
   Conclusions-This is one of the first studies to show that recreational
   sports are safe. Although the likelihood of injury was greatest in the
   first month of the season, few injuries required admission to hospital
   or emergency department treatment. A greater emphasis on prevention in
   the early part of the season should help to reduce the elevated
   incidence of injury found at this time.}},

Abstract = {{Football is one of the most popular sports worldwide. The frequency of
   football injuries is estimated to be approximately 10 to 35 per 1000
   playing hours. The majority of injuries occur in the lower extremities,
   mainly in the knees and ankles; the number of head injuries is probably
   underestimated. The average cost for medical treatment per football
   injury is estimated to be \$150 (U.S. dollars). Considering the number
   of active football players worldwide, the socioeconomic and financial
   consequences of injury are of such a proportion that a prevention
   program to reduce the incidence of injuries is urgently required. For
   this reason, an analysis of intrinsic (person-related) and extrinsic
   (environment-related) risk factors was undertaken based on a review of
   the current literature. It was concluded that the epidemiologic
   information regarding the sports medicine aspects of football injuries
   is inconsistent and far from complete because of the employment of
   heterogeneous methods, various definitions of injury, and different
   characteristics of the assessed teams. The aim of this study was to
   analyze the literature on the incidence of injuries and symptoms in
   football players, as well as to identify risk factors for injury and to
   demonstrate possibilities for injury prevention.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the hypothesis that sentimental betters can affect the path
   of prices in football betting markets. We hypothesize that sentimental
   traders follow the advice of false experts, believe excessively in
   momentum strategies, bet excessively on teams that are well known and
   covered in the media. We generate proxies for these sources of sentiment
   and show that point spreads move predictably over the course of the
   week, partially in response to variables known prior to the opening of
   betting. We show that a betting strategy of betting against the
   predicted movement in the point spread is borderline profitable.}},

Abstract = {{Context The potential seriousness of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI)
   is increasingly recognized; however, information on the frequency of
   MTBI among high school athletes is limited.
   Objective To identify the type, frequency, and severity of MTBI in
   selected high school sports activities.
   Design Observational cohort study..
   Setting and Participants Two hundred forty-six certified athletic
   trainers recorded injury and exposure data for high school varsity
   athletes participating in boys' football, wrestling, baseball and field
   hockey, girls' volleyball and softball, boys' and girls' basketball, and
   boys' and girls' soccer at 235 US high schools during 1 or more of the
   1995-1997 academic years.
   Main Outcome Measures Rates of reported MTBI, defined as a head-injured
   player who was removed from participation and evaluated by an athletic
   trainer or physician prior to returning to participation. National
   incidence figures for MTBI also were estimated.
   Results Of 23 566 reported injuries in the 10 sports during the 3-year
   study period, 1219 (5.5 \%) were MTBIs. Of the MTBIs, football accounted
   for 773 (63.4\%) of cases; wrestling, 128 (10.5\%); girls' soccer, 76
   (6.2\%); boys' soccer, 69 (5.7\%); girls' basketball, 63 (5.2\%); boys'
   basketball, 51 (4.2\%); softball, 25 (2.1\%); baseball, 15 (1.2\%);
   field hockey, 13 (1.1\%); and volleyball, 6 (0.5\%). The injury rates
   per 100 player-seasons were 3.66 for football, 1.58 for wrestling, 1.14
   for girls' soccer, 1.04 for girls' basketball, 0.92 for boys' soccer,
   0.75 for boys' basketball, 0.46 for softball, 0.46 for field hockey,
   0.23 for baseball, and 0.14 for volleyball. The median time lost from
   participation for all MTBIs was 3 days. There were 6 cases of subdural
   hematoma and intracranial injury reported in football. Based on these
   data, an estimated 62 816 cases of MTBI occur annually among high school
   varsity athletes participating in these sports, with football accounting
   for about 63 \% of cases.
   Conclusions Rates of MTBI vary among sports and none of the 10 popular
   high school sports we studied is without the occurrence of an MTBI.
   Continued involvement of high school sports sponsors, researchers,
   medical professionals, coaches, and sports participants is essential to
   help minimize the risk of MTBI.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The ongoing controversy over Title IX, requiring university
   athletic departments to provide equal participation opportunities to men
   and women, has been the source of heated controversy. The purpose of
   this research is to determine how much remains to be done before
   ``proportionality{''} is achieved, i.e., before the number of female
   athletes matches the female percentage of a school's student body, as
   well as how various proposals would affect compliance. Methods. We
   analyze data on the gender composition of 304 Division I athletic
   programs and student bodies to determine what each school needs to
   accomplish through strategies of adding female athletes, cutting male
   athletes, or reallocating participation opportunities from women to men.
   Results. Most schools-especially those with football teams-are nowhere
   near compliance. Compliance is more approachable for schools with a
   smaller proportion of female students, with more financial resources for
   female athletics, with a smaller athletic program, and without a
   football team. Compliance is still unlikely or, at best, far in the
   future for most schools even if certain NCAA rules and federal
   regulations are enacted. Conclusions. The reallocation strategy appears
   to present the most inviting avenue to compliance, although the only
   scenarios in which most football schools come close to compliance would
   involve exempting football from Title IX coverage or placing a
   fifty-player cap on football rosters, neither of which seems likely in
   the near future.}},

Abstract = {{Retirement from sport poses a major socioemotional threat to elite

   examining the vacuum created in an athlete's life after retirement.
   Grounded theory was used to construct how elite football players dealt
   with forced retirement owing to injury and deselection. Recursive
   in-depth interviews were conducted with 30 recently retired players who
   had competed at the highest level in Australian Rules football. The data
   were characterized by a rich array of personal, reflections of loss and
   grief that that reflected four themes: loss of identity, perceived
   control, financial issues, and social support. Interviewees typically
   told stories that were tinged with shock, regret, bitterness, distress,
   and perceived loss of status.}},

Abstract = {{Male ice hockey fans (N = 78) completed a battery of biographical,
   social, cognitive, and individual differences measures that had

   Significant determinants include match quality and sequence, distance
   between each participant and the host country, probability of tournament
   success, derby games, indigenous support together with the presence of
   either home team in a match. Given the importance of such international

   A retrospective analysis}},

Year = {{1997}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study assessed changes in the incidence and causes of
   mandibular fractures occurring in Innsbruck, Austria between 1984 and
   1993.
   Patients and Methods: Records from 712 patients sustaining 982
   mandibular fractures were reviewed and analyzed according to age, sex,
   date of fracture, place of trauma, cause, anatomic site of fracture, and
   associated orofacial and craniocerebral injuries.
   Results: Sports were the most common cause of mandibular fractures,
   accounting for 31.5\% of the entire sample, followed by road traffic
   accidents (27.2\%) and falls (20.8\%). The yearly distribution of
   sport-related mandibular fractures showed an increase from 28.6\% in
   1984 to 1988 to 34.5\% in 1989 to 1993. The major causative factor in
   sports-related mandibular fractures was skiing (55.3\%), whereas cycling
   and soccer accounted for 25.4\% and 8.9\%, respectively. Significant
   changes in the occurrence of cycling-related mandibular fractures were
   observed, with an increase of 19.3\% from 1984 to 1988 to 1989 to 1993,
   whereas skiing-related mandibular fractures showed a decrease of similar
   magnitude (19.5\%). Sex distribution showed a male-to-female ratio of
   2.5:1, with the percentage of females involved increasing, In cases of
   cycling-related accidents, there was a considerable prevalence of
   associated injuries (133.3 injuries per 100 mandibular fractures), with
   significantly higher rates of facial lacerations (73.2), tooth fractures
   (39), tooth luxations (24.4), and orbital fractures (3.7) than in the
   case of skiing-related injuries, whereas in patients sustaining
   mandibular fractures caused by soccer, mucosal lacerations, tooth
   luxations, and cerebral concussions were the only associated injuries
   found.
   Conclusions: The results of this study indicate a considerable change in
   the cause of mandibular fractures, showing that sporting injuries are
   becoming increasingly common. The high incidence of associated
   maxillofacial injuries in patients involved in skiing and cycling
   accidents may suggest an increasing need for preventive and protective
   measures.}},

Abstract = {{in this 3-year longitudinal study, we studied lumbar mobility and the
   occurrence of low back pain among 98 adolescents who were free of
   previous severe low back pain: 33 nonathletes (16 boys, 17 girls), 34
   boy athletes (ice hockey and soccer players) and 31 girl athletes
   (figure skaters and gymnasts). During the followup, low back pain
   lasting longer than 1 week was reported by 29 athletes (15 boys and 14
   girls) and by 6 nonathletes (3 boys and 3 girls). in multivariate
   analyses, participation in sports and low maximal lumbar flexion at the
   baseline predicted low back pain during the followup among boys;
   however, these factors accounted for only 16\% of the variability
   between the groups with and without low back pain. Among girls,
   decreased range of motion in the lower lumbar segments, low maximal
   lumbar extension, and high body weight at the baseline were predictive
   of low back pain during the followup, accounting for 31\% of the
   variability between the groups. The girls in the lowest tertile of
   maximal lumbar extension at baseline had a relative risk of 3.4 to have
   future low back pain compared with those in the highest tertile. We
   conclude that the low individual physiologic maximum of lower segment
   lumbar extension mobility may cause overloading of the low back among
   athletes involved in sports with frequent maximal lumbar extension and
   that it predicts future low back pain.}},

Abstract = {{Hamstring muscle strain is the most prevalent injury in Australian Rules
   Football, accounting for 16\% of playing time missed as a result of
   injury. Thirty-seven professional footballers from an Australian
   Football League team had preseason measurements of hamstring and
   quadriceps muscle concentric peak torque at 60, 180, and 300 deg/sec
   measured on a Cybex 340 dynamometer. Players were studied prospectively
   throughout the 1995 season. During that time, six players sustained
   clinically diagnosed hamstring muscle injuries that caused them to miss
   match-playing time. The injured hamstring muscles were all weaker than
   in the opposite leg in absolute values and hamstring-to-quadriceps
   muscle ratios. According to our t-test results, hamstring muscle injury
   was significantly associated with a low hamstring-to-quadriceps muscle
   peak torque ratio at 60 deg/sec on the injured side and a low hamstring
   muscle side-to-side peak torque ratio at 60 deg/sec. Flexibility (as
   measured by the sit-and-reach test) did not correlate with injury.
   Discriminant-function analysis using the two significant ratio variables
   resulted in a canonical correlation with injury of 0.4594 and correctly
   classified legs into injury groups with 77.4\% success. These results
   indicate that preseason isokinetic testing of professional Australian
   Rules footballers can identify players at risk of developing hamstring
   muscle strains.}},

Abstract = {{Background: A deployed U.S. Navy aircraft carrier is a hazardous
   environment where work and recreation intermingle. Injuries causing time
   lost from assigned duties may impact aviation safety and operational
   readiness. This descriptive study examines injuries sustained on the
   flight deck, in the hangar bay, or in the gym of a deployed aircraft
   carrier, focusing on those injuries resulting in lost duty days.
   Methods: Injuries recorded by the ship's medical department were
   analyzed, relating lost duty injuries to the following parameters:
   division, rank, time of day, location of injury event, whether injury
   was job-related or recreational, type of recreational activity, and
   mechanism, type, and anatomic site of injury. Results: During a 6-mo
   deployment, 335 injuries occurred in the shipboard locations studied.
   More than one-third (36\%) of these injuries resulted in lost duty time,
   accounting for 768 man-days of lost duty during the deployment.
   Recreational injuries represented 19\% of all injuries, but 25\% of all
   lost duty injuries, a statistically significant contribution to lost
   duty time when compared to job-related injuries (p = 0.04). The sports
   of basketball, volleyball, and football were more likely than other
   recreational activities to cause injuries resulting in lost duty time (p
   = 0.01). Musculoskeletal injuries, particularly injuries involving the
   lower extremity, neck, and back, were also associated with increased
   risk of lost duty time (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Although recreational
   injuries are less frequent than job-related injuries in the study
   population, they contribute disproportionately to lost duty time. Injury
   prevention in similar environments should address recreational as well
   as work-related activities.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To ascertain the epidemiological characteristics of sports
   injuries in children in Hong Kong.
   Methods-Retrospective review of all cases seen in the Sports Injury
   Clinic of the Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, Hong Kong, in the period
   May 1984 to December 1990. The variables studied were age at
   presentation, gender, side of the body injured, anatomical location of
   the injury, type and severity of injury, sport played, level (school,
   recreational, amateur and professional) and frequency of sports
   participation, length in years of sports practice, and initial
   management of the injury. Results-Of the 2293 patients seen, 238 were
   youngsters (54\% boys) 16 years old or younger. Ball games accounted for
   the greatest number of injuries, with 37 children taking part in
   basketball, 28 in soccer, 12 in volleyball, and 31 children taking part
   in a variety of other ball games. Of the remaining children, the single
   largest group was practising track and field, with sprinting and middle
   distance running accounting for 42 injuries, and 28 children were
   injured while cycling. Most of the injuries (85\%) were classified as
   non-serious, but 15\% of children presented with a total of 21
   fractures, two joint dislocations, five concussions, and seven torn knee
   ligaments.
   Conclusions-Children sports participation in Hong Kong, although not at
   high level and not as widespread as in the West, accounts for
   significant morbidity. These injuries should be carefully monitored to
   ascertain whether they result in any detrimental long term effects.}},

Abstract = {{A recent development in the UK television industry has been the
   emergence of satellite coverage of sporting events. This paper examines
   the relationship between broadcasting and football, culminating in the
   1992 joint BBC and BSkyB contract to televise the English Premier
   League. A demand function is estimated which extends the familiar model
   of attendance to incorporate television together with quadratic
   functions. We find that, although live transmission reduces attendance,
   the net financial consequences are positive for Premier League teams.
   Moreover, significant estimators are found for the quadratic functions
   of price, earnings, distance, seasonal trend and length of Premier

Abstract = {{Objective.-To develop clinical, demographic, and pathological profiles
   of young competitive athletes who died suddenly,
   Design.-Systematic evaluation of clinical information and circumstances
   associated with sudden deaths; interviews with family members,
   witnesses, and coaches; and analyses of postmortem anatomic,
   microscopic, and toxicologic data.
   Participants and Setting.-A total of 158 sudden deaths that occurred in
   trained athletes throughout the United States from 1985 through 1995
   were analyzed.
   Main Outcome Measures.-Characteristics and probable cause of death,
   Results.-Of 158 sudden deaths among athletes, 24 (15\%) were explained
   by noncardiovascular causes, Among the 134 athletes who had
   cardiovascular causes of sudden death, the median age was 17 years
   (range, 12-40 years), 120 (90\%) were male, 70 (52\%) were white, and 59
   (44\%) were black. The most common competitive sports involved were
   basketball (47 cases) and football (45 cases), together accounting for
   68\% of sudden deaths, A total of 121 athletes (90\%) collapsed during
   or immediately after a training session (78 cases) or a formal athletic
   contest (43 cases), with 80 deaths (63\%) occurring between 3 PM and 9
   PM, The most common structural cardiovascular diseases identified at
   autopsy as the primary cause of death were hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
   (48 athletes {[}36\%]), which was disproportionately prevalent in black
   athletes compared with white athletes (48\% vs 26\% of deaths; P=.01),
   and malformations involving anomalous coronary artery origin (17
   athletes {[}13\%]), Of 115 athletes who had a standard preparticipation
   medical evaluation, only 4 (3\%) were suspected of having cardiovascular
   disease, and the cardiovascular abnormality responsible for sudden death
   was correctly identified in only 1 athlete (0.9\%).
   Conclusions.-Sudden death in young competitive athletes usually is
   precipitated by physical activity and may be due to a heterogeneous
   spectrum of cardiovascular disease, most commonly hypertrophic
   cardiomyopathy. Preparticipation screening appeared to be of limited
   value in identification of underlying cardiovascular abnormalities.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we analyze data for each Division I National Collegiate
   Athletic Association (NCAA) school on academic characteristics, athletic
   characteristics, and graduation rates. Three groups of athletes are
   studied: male football players, male basketball players, and female
   basketball players. We find strong empirical evidence that traditional
   labor market opportunities unrelated to sports are significant
   explanatory variables of the persistence of athletes. In addition, we
   find support for the hypothesis that professional opportunities have a
   significant impact on the graduation rate of athletes. This impact is
   stronger in sports with higher expected financial returns from this form
   of nondegree employment.}},

Volume = {{28}},

Pages = {{291-297}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{While the topic of path dependence has reappeared in some macroeconomic
   circles, the existence of path dependence of voting outcomes is still
   more a matter of speculation than of evidence in spite of its importance
   to Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. This analysis considers the empirical
   relevance of path dependence, drawing data from Associated Press college
   football polls. In major college football, the primary measure of
   success is a team's year-end ranking by sports writers and/or coaches,
   ostensibly based on performance. This article examines the degree to
   which the year-end orderings for teams, R(ik), are influenced by
   initial, pre-season rankings, R(i1), and mid-season rankings, R(im),
   using these `Top 20' votes for 1980-1989, while accounting for various
   measures of team performance. In addition to OLS estimates, cumulative
   legit models (CLM) and censored logistic regression (CLR) are used to
   deal with ordinality and sample problems. The results in Section III
   indicate a relationship between pre-and post-season votes strong enough
   to have influenced many polls' outcomes, including the designation of
   the `national champion' in at least one year of the sample.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To report the occurrence of uncommon but catastrophic eye and
   testicle injuries to rugby league and rugby union footballers in New
   South Wales,
   Methods: A retrospective review of players who had permanent
   football-related injuries and who claimed financial compensation from a
   voluntary sports injury insurance scheme from 1978-1994,
   Results: An average of 100 000 rugby league and rugby union players per
   year were registered with the insurance scheme in NSW. As a consequence
   of playing football, 15 players lost 90\%-100\% vision in one eye, five
   lost 75\% vision in one eye, four lost 50\% of vision in one eye and two
   lost 75\% vision in both eyes, Eye injuries were caused by `'gouging''
   with fingers, kicks, or blows from fists, elbows and knees; five cases
   appeared to be intentional, Fourteen players had testicular injuries: in
   11 players this resulted in complete loss of one testicle, and in three
   partial loss of one or both testicles. The immediate cause of the
   injuries to the testicles was kicking and kneeing, usually during
   tackles; at least three of the injuries appeared to be intentional,
   Recommendations: Rules relating to tackles, kicks and other assaults to
   the head or groin should be strengthened and policed, Officials,
   players, parents and the public should be educated to support this,}},

Abstract = {{Elite adult athletes are known to have physical and physiological
   characteristics specifically suited to their sport. However, it is not
   clear whether the observed adult differences arise because of training
   or whether the sport selects the individual with the appropriate
   characteristics. The purpose of this prospective study was to compare
   and contrast the physical development of young athletes (8-19 years),
   and in so doing provide a possible response to this question.
   Development of anthropometric characteristics and sexual maturation were
   assessed in a group of 232 male athletes for three consecutive years.
   Parental heights were used to predict target heights. The subjects were
   a randomly selected group of young British athletes, from four sports:
   soccer, gymnastics, swimming and tennis. Using a linked longitudinal
   cohort study design (age cohorts 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 years) it was
   possible to estimate a consecutive 11-year development pattern, over the
   3-year testing period. The adjusted mean (ANCOVA) height, accounting for
   age and pubertal status, of male swimmers (161.6+/-0.6 cm) was found to
   be significantly greater (p<0.01) than gymnasts (150.7+/-0.8 cm) and
   soccer players (158.7+/-0.6 cm), and their adjusted mean body mass
   (51.3+/-0.6 kg) significantly greater (p<0.01) than the other groups.
   When testicular volumes were compared, it was found that swimmers had
   significantly larger volumes than gymnasts and tennis players from 14 to
   16 years of age (p<0.05). Gymnasts' growth curve of testis size was
   characteristic of late maturers, the swimmers' curve was characteristic
   of early maturers. As all the young athletes started training prior to
   puberty the observed late sexual maturation of gymnasts and early
   maturation of swimmers suggests some form of sports-specific selection.
   Training did not appear to have affected these young athletes' growth
   and development; rather their continued success in sport appeared to be
   related to inherited traits.}},

Abstract = {{Balance in Alpine skiing is dynamic and tenuous. Loss of balance
   typically leads to the accumulation of forces that create severe bending
   moments at the knee. The modern ski binding, while effective at
   protecting the ankle and Lower leg, is much less effective at protecting
   the knee. The result: knee injuries have increased nearly threefold
   since 1972 with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries currently
   accounting for approximately 10\% of all skiing injuries. The mechanism
   of ACL injury in elite competitors is distinct from recreational skiers
   and is typically associated with a characteristic, deeply flexed, seared
   body position, with the feet accelerating forward relative to the upper
   body. The risk of ACL injury in elite skiers is compounded by the
   functional characteristics of the modern ski binding and further
   exacerbated by the protocols used to set release tension for
   competition. It is apparent that the physical abilities of the elite
   competitor, combined with modern ski technique and equipment, expose the
   skier to forces that the human body cannot tolerate. Presently, the only
   solution to the problem would appear to be the development of
   `'smarter'' bindings and/or the adoption of standards that set
   limitations on performance for the sake of safety.}},

   were calculated per 100 player-hours. The overall injury rates for male
   and female players were similar, 5.04 and 5.03, respectively. The lowest
   injury rate was found among the 19- to 24-year-old athletes and the
   highest injury rate was found among the oldest age group
   (greater-than-or-equal-to 25 years). Collision with another player was
   the most common activity at the time of injury, accounting for 31\% of
   all injuries. The most common injury types were sprains and muscle
   contusions, both occurring at a rate of 1.1 injuries per 100
   player-hours. Male players suffered a significantly higher rate of ankle
   ligament injuries compared with female players (1.24 versus 0.43, P <
   0.05), while female players suffered a significantly higher rate of knee

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine injury profiles for the elite level competitions
   of football played in Australia.
   Design: Over the 1992 seasons, all injuries were prospectively recorded
   from 26 clubs in football competitions which included the Australian
   Football League (AFL), New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) and New
   South Wales Rugby Union (NSWRU).
   Results: Some 2398 injuries were reported. In Australian Rules football,
   the most common injury was the hamstring tear (13\%); this also
   accounted for the most time missed due to injury (16\%). In rugby league
   and union, the most common injuries were head and facial lacerations
   (11\% and 20\%) followed by concussion (8\% and 5\%). The injuries
   accounting for most time missed were fractures and knee ligament
   injuries in the rugby codes. In Australian Rules football there were
   more lower limb muscle strain injuries, a high proportion of which were
   recurrences, with a significant incidence during training sessions. In
   the rugby codes, minor injuries to the head and neck were more common,
   particularly in forwards. While rugby league players suffered the most
   injuries, AFL injuries were on average more severe and consequently the
   total time missed through injury by players in these two codes was very
   similar. Rugby union had a significantly lower injury prevalence at the
   elite club competition level than rugby league or Australian Rules
   football.
   Conclusion: Injury rates in the elite football competitions are high,
   warranting ongoing analysis and further study in particular areas.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies investigating the effects of training in children have
   been hampered in their interpretation by the confounding effects of
   growth and development. We followed the development of maximal aerobic
   power (VO2max) in 453 athletes drawn from soccer, swimming, gymnastics,
   and tennis. Study design was of a mixed longitudinal type with five age
   cohorts (8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 yr) followed for 3 consecutive years. A
   multilevel regression modeling procedure was used to identify the
   independent effects of predictor variables while accounting for the
   effects of growth, such as changes in body size. When age, height, and
   weight were controlled for, VO2max in males significantly increased with
   pubertal status, indicated by the coefficient value of 0.15 l/min being
   greater than its associated SE of 0.07 I/min. Females showed a similar
   pattern, with a coefficient value of 0.13 +/- 0.07 l/min, although the
   significant increase in VO2max (P < 0.05) found in males in the latter
   stages of puberty was not shown in females. Swimmers had the highest
   VO2max values (P < 0.001) at all ages.}},

Abstract = {{In 1 year, 715 patients with soccer injuries were registered and treated
   in the emergency department of Randers City Hospital. We did a
   prospective study of these patients using a questionnaire to determine
   the most common locations, types, mechanisms, and treatments of injury.
   Financial costs for society and the individual were also examined.
   Forty-nine percent of the injuries were to the joints; sprains and
   contusions were the most common types of injury, accounting for 46\% and
   25\%, respectively. The majority of patients (64\% of the men and 58\%
   of the women) were injured during physical contact with another player.
   Most (63\%) of the patients were treated in the emergency department and
   then released. Thirty-one percent had to be absent from work, but only
   8\% of the patients had a loss of income because of their injury. The
   average amount of work time lost was 5 days.}},

Abstract = {{Wishful thinking (WT)-defined as predicting a more favorable outcome for

   hypothesized, the intensity of WT varied between contexts as a function
   of the ``legitimacy{''} of emotionalism and subjectivity. and within
   each context as a function of self-defined levels of fanhood and
   preference. An explicit instruction to be objective did not reduce WT in
   predicting game outcomes. Paid betting forms represented an ecologically
   valid voluntary behavior most contradictory of wishful thinking, since
   bettors are strongly motivated to be objective and impartial. The
   results showed that fans could not overcome their wishful thinking,
   betting emotionally and against their financial interest.}},

Abstract = {{As many as 1.5 million young men participate in American football in the
   United States.  An estimated 1.2 million football-related injuries are
   sustained annually.  Since the 1970s epidemiological studies have shown
   that the risk of injury is higher in older athletes and lower in teams
   with more experienced coaches and more assistant coaches.  51\% of
   injuries occurred at training; contact sessions were 4.7 times more
   likely to produce injuries than controlled sessions.  Injury rates were
   reduced by wearing shorter cleats and preseason conditioning.
   Overall, lower extremity injuries accounted for 50\% of all injuries
   (with knee injuries accounting for up to 36\%).  Upper extremity
   injuries accounted for 30\%.  In general, sprains and strains account
   for 40\% of injuries, contusions 25\%, fractures 10\%, concussions 5\%
   and dislocations 15\%.
   Cervical spine injuries have the potential to be catastrophic, but they
   declined dramatically in the decade 1975 to 1984, due to the impact of
   rule changes modifying tackling and blocking techniques and improved
   fitness, equipment and coaching.  Appropriate diagnostic evaluation of
   cervical injuries is mandatory.
   The evidence supporting prophylactic knee bracing is not compelling and
   does not mandate compulsory or routine use.
   Return to play criteria include:  full range of motion; normal strength;
   normal neurological evaluation; no joint swelling or instability;
   ability to run and sustain contact without pain; no intake of pain
   medication; player education about preventive measures and future risks.
    These criteria should be strictly observed.
   In addition to ankle and knee rehabilitation, lumbar spine injuries
   present a challenge for the physician.  Repetitive flexion, extension
   and torsional stresses predispose the lumbar spine to injury. 
   Rehabilitation consists of pain control and training.  The training
   phase aims to eliminate repetitive injuries by minimising stress at the
   intervertebral joint.
   Football is a high risk sport.  Coaches, players, trainers and
   physicians must all become aware of the proper means to prevent
   injuries.}},

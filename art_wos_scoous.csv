"LEES B, 2020, BMC PUBLIC HEALTH";"BACKGROUNDSCREEN MEDIA IS AMONG THE MOST COMMON RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES ENGAGED IN BY CHILDREN. THE DISPLACEMENT HYPOTHESIS PREDICTS THAT INCREASED TIME SPENT ON SCREEN MEDIA ACTIVITY (SMA) MAY BE AT THE EXPENSE OF ENGAGEMENT WITH OTHER RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS SPORT, MUSIC, AND ART. THIS STUDY EXAMINED ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN NON-EDUCATIONAL SMA AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY ENDORSEMENT IN 9-10-YEAR-OLDS, WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR OTHER INDIVIDUAL (I.E., COGNITION, PSYCHOPATHOLOGY), INTERPERSONAL (I.E., SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT), AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS.METHODSPARTICIPANTS WERE 9254 YOUTH FROM THE ADOLESCENT BRAIN COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT STUDY (R). LATENT FACTORS REFLECTING SMA, COGNITION, PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT WERE ENTERED AS INDEPENDENT VARIABLES INTO LOGISTIC MIXED MODELS. SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC COVARIATES INCLUDED AGE, SEX, RACE/ETHNICITY, EDUCATION, MARITAL STATUS, AND HOUSEHOLD INCOME. OUTCOME VARIABLES INCLUDED ANY RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY ENDORSEMENT (OF 19 ASSESSED), AND SPECIFIC SPORT (SWIMMING, SOCCER, BASEBALL) AND HOBBY (MUSIC, ART) ENDORSEMENTS.RESULTSIN UNADJUSTED GROUPWISE COMPARISONS, YOUTH WHO SPENT MORE TIME ENGAGING WITH SMA WERE LESS LIKELY TO ENGAGE WITH OTHER RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES (PS<.001). HOWEVER, WHEN VARIANCE IN COGNITION, PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT, AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC COVARIATES WERE ACCOUNTED FOR, MOST FORMS OF SMA WERE NO LONGER SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY ENGAGEMENT (P>.05). SOME MARGINAL EFFECTS WERE OBSERVED: FOR EVERY ONE SD INCREASE IN TIME SPENT ON GAMES AND MOVIES OVER MORE SOCIAL FORMS OF MEDIA, YOUTH WERE AT LOWER ODDS OF ENGAGING IN RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO=0.83, 95\% CI 0.76-0.89). LIKEWISE, GREATER GENERAL SMA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER ODDS OF ENDORSING GROUP-BASED SPORTS, INCLUDING SOCCER (0.93, 0.88-0.98) AND BASEBALL (0.92, 0.86-0.98). MODEL FIT COMPARISONS INDICATED THAT SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, PARTICULARLY SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS, EXPLAINED MORE VARIANCE IN RATES OF RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY ENGAGEMENT THAN SMA AND OTHER LATENT FACTORS. NOTABLY, YOUTH FROM HIGHER SOCIO-ECONOMIC FAMILIES WERE UP TO 5.63 (3.83-8.29) TIMES MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES THAN YOUTH FROM LOWER SOCIO-ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS.CONCLUSIONSRESULTS DID NOT SUGGEST THAT SMA LARGELY DISPLACES ENGAGEMENT IN OTHER RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES AMONG 9-10-YEAR-OLDS. INSTEAD, SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS GREATLY CONTRIBUTE TO RATES OF ENGAGEMENT. THESE FINDINGS ARE IMPORTANT CONSIDERING RECENT SHIFTS IN TIME SPENT ON SMA IN CHILDHOOD."
"FACCIA A, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY";"ALL SPORTS HAVE THEIR ROOTS AND CONNECTION IN SOME WAY TO THE OLYMPIC SPIRIT, AND THEREFORE FALL WITHIN THE VISION AND MISSION OF THE OLYMPIC COMMITTEE, WHICH HAS A CENTRAL AIM OF ``BUILDING A BETTER WORLD''. THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL VALUE OF THE OLYMPICS AND SUSTAINABILITY IS A ``WORKING PRINCIPLE'' OF THIS. THIS RESEARCH ANALYSES THE PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL EUROPEAN FOOTBALL TEAMS THAT ARE PUBLICLY LISTED ON STOCK MARKETS, ANALYSING THEIR INCOME STATEMENTS AND FACTORING IN HOW THE VALUE-ADDED PERSPECTIVE IS IMPACTING PROFESSIONAL SPORT. THE METHODOLOGY WE USE CONSIDERS THE SUSTAINABLE CONTRIBUTION OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF ADDED VALUE. THE VALUE-ADDED STATEMENT IS CONSIDERED AS A PART OF BROADER CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR), WHICH CAN BE TRACED BACK AS A CONCEPT TO THE LATE 1970S. IT IS STILL IN WIDESPREAD USE AND IS REGARDED AS BEING BOTH A CREDIBLE AND A TESTED MEASURE. IN THIS PAPER, THE AUTHORS APPLY A SLIGHTLY MODIFIED AND SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF THIS VALUE-ADDED APPROACH TO ALL PUBLICLY LISTED EUROPEAN FOOTBALL CLUBS AND USE THESE AS A PROXY FOR WIDER PROFESSIONAL SPORT. THIS RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT, ALTHOUGH MOST PROFESSIONAL SPORTS CLUBS ARE PROFIT-ORIENTED, THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH GENERATED BY THE ADDED VALUE IS UNBALANCED. IN MOST CASES, AT LEAST IN FINANCIAL TERMS, THE DATA SHOWS SHAREHOLDERS ARE THE MOST DISADVANTAGED, WHEREAS ATHLETES ARE THE MOST REWARDED."
"GONER D, 2020, EUR J OPER RES";"BALANCING THE ALLOCATION OF GAMES IN SPORTS COMPETITIONS IS AN IMPORTANT ORGANIZATIONAL TASK THAT CAN HAVE SERIOUS FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXAMINE DATA FROM 10,142 SOCCER GAMES PLAYED IN THE TOP GERMAN, SPANISH, FRENCH, AND ENGLISH SOCCER LEAGUES BETWEEN 2007/2008 AND 2016/2017. USING A MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUE FOR VARIABLE SELECTION AND APPLYING A SEMI-PARAMETRIC ANALYSIS OF RADIUS MATCHING ON THE PROPENSITY SCORE, WE FIND THAT ALL FOUR LEAGUES HAVE A LOWER ATTENDANCE IN GAMES THAT TAKE PLACE ON FOUR NON-FREQUENTLY PLAYED DAYS THAN THOSE ON THREE FREQUENTLY PLAYED DAYS. WE ALSO FIND THAT, IN ALL LEAGUES, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER HOME ADVANTAGE FOR THE UNDERDOG TEAMS ON NON-FREQUENT DAYS. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE CURRENT SCHEDULE FAVORS UNDERDOG TEAMS WITH FEWER HOME GAMES ON NON-FREQUENT DAYS. THEREFORE, TO INCREASE THE FAIRNESS OF THE COMPETITIONS, IT IS NECESSARY TO ADJUST THE ALLOCATION OF THE HOME GAMES ON NON-FREQUENT DAYS IN A WAY THAT ELIMINATES ANY ADVANTAGE DRIVEN BY THE SCHEDULE.

"ZUELCH H, 2020, SPORT BUS MANAG";"PURPOSE THIS STUDY DERIVES A NEW FRAMEWORK THAT COMPREHENSIVELY ASSESSES MANAGEMENT QUALITY ALONG FOUR DIMENSIONS, NAMELY SPORTING SUCCESS; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; FAN WELFARE MAXIMIZATION; AND LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE. FILLED WITH MEASURABLE KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIS), THESE DIMENSIONS SERVE THE PURPOSE OF OBJECTIVELY QUANTIFYING THE RELEVANT SUCCESS FACTORS. ULTIMATELY, THE PERFORMANCE IN ALL DIMENSIONS INDICATES A FOOTBALL CLUB'S MANAGEMENT QUALITY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE STUDY RELIES FIRST ON A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE IN THE FIELD OF BOTH GENERAL MANAGEMENT AND SPORTS. SECOND, THE AUTHORS ADAPT THE BALANCED SCORECARD FRAMEWORK TO THE FIELD OF PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL AND USE A SET OF KPIS TO ASSESS THE MANAGEMENT QUALITY OF THE BUNDESLIGA TEAMS OVER THE SEASONS 2016/17 AND 2017/18. THIRD, THE AUTHORS VALIDATE THE RELATIVE WEIGHTS OF THE FOUR DIMENSIONS COMPOSING THE SO-CALLED ``FOOTBALL MANAGEMENT QUALITY SCORE'' (I.E. FOMA Q-SCORE) USING EXPERT INTERVIEWS. FINDINGS TWO MOVEMENTS CHARACTERIZE THE SCORE DEVELOPMENT IN 2017/18 COMPARED TO 2016/17: FIRST, SCORES APPEAR MORE CONTRACTED THAN PREVIOUSLY. SECOND, BOTH AVERAGE AND MEDIAN SCORES IMPROVED, SUGGESTING A GENERAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT QUALITY WITHIN THE BUNDESLIGA. ORIGINALITY/VALUE TO THE BEST OF THE AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST EXPLORATORY STUDY DERIVING AND MEASURING RELEVANT KEY CRITERIA FOR MANAGING FOOTBALL CLUBS AND ILLUSTRATING THE FINDINGS IN A RANKING. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO ESTABLISH A MODEL THAT IMPACTS BOTH ACADEMIA AND PRACTICE. BY UTILIZING EXISTING MANAGEMENT LITERATURE AND ADJUSTING IT TO FOOTBALL PARTICULARITIES, THE NEWFOUND KNOWLEDGE BEGINS TO CLOSE THE GAP IN SPORT MANAGEMENT LITERATURE."
"PRIGGE S, 2020, SPORT BUS MANAG";"PURPOSE THE AIMS OF THE RESEARCH ARE TWOFOLD: (1) EXPLORING WHETHER FOOTBALL CLUB STOCKS CAN BE CONSIDERED AN ASSET CLASS OF THEIR OWN; (2) INVESTIGATING WHETHER FOOTBALL STOCKS ENABLE WELL-DIVERSIFIED INVESTORS TO ACHIEVE MORE EFFICIENT RISK-RETURN COMBINATIONS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH USING EFFICIENT FRONTIER OPTIMIZATION, A BASE PORTFOLIO, WITH STANDARD STOCKS AND BONDS, AND A CORRESPONDING ENHANCED PORTFOLIO, WHICH INCLUDES FOOTBALL STOCKS IN THE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY SET, ARE DEFINED. THIS PROCEDURE IS APPLIED TO FOUR PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION RULES. PAIRWISE COMPARISONS OF PORTFOLIO SHARPE RATIOS INCLUDE A TEST FOR STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. FINDINGS THE RESULTS INDICATE A LOW CORRELATION OF FOOTBALL STOCKS AND STANDARD STOCKS; THUS, FOOTBALL STOCKS COULD BE CONSIDERED AN ASSET CLASS OF THEIR OWN. NEVERTHELESS, THE ADDITION OF FOOTBALL STOCKS TO A WELL-DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO DOES NOT IMPROVE ITS RISK-RETURN EFFICIENCY BECAUSE THE WEAK PERFORMANCE OF FOOTBALL STOCKS ELIMINATES THEIR ADVANTAGE OF LOW CORRELATION. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE EVIDENCE THAT INVESTMENTS IN FOOTBALL ARE DIFFERENT FROM `ORDINARY' INVESTMENTS AND NEED FURTHER RESEARCH, PARTICULARLY INTO MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR INVESTMENT MOTIVES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOOTBALL STOCKS ARE NOT ATTRACTIVE TO PURE FINANCIAL INVESTORS. THUS, FOOTBALL CLUBS NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHICH SIDE BENEFITS ARE APPRECIATED BY WHICH KIND OF INVESTOR AND HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO PRODUCE THESE SIDE BENEFITS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE TO THE BEST OF AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO ANALYSE THE RISK-RETURN EFFICIENCY OF FOOTBALL STOCKS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A PURE FINANCIAL INVESTOR, I.E. AN INVESTOR IN FOOTBALL STOCKS WHO DOES NOT EARN SIDE BENEFITS, SUCH AS STRATEGIC INVESTORS OR FAN INVESTORS."
"SOTI A, 2020, SOC NETW ANAL MIN";"THE INTERRELATION BETWEEN THE FLUCTUATIONS OF STOCK PRICES OF FOOTBALL CLUBS AND THE SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVITY OF THEIR FANS IS OF MAJOR ECONOMIC INTEREST. THE RESULTS IN THIS RESEARCH PROVIDE MEASURABLE SUPPORT FOR THE SUGGESTION THAT FINANCIAL MARKET ACTIVITIES AND THE NUMBER OF TWEETS ARE LINKED IN THE CASE OF BIG FOOTBALL CLUBS. THE NOVELTY OF THE RESEARCH IS TO SHOW WHICH DAILY RATIO OF TWEET COUNTS AND THEIR MOOD CAN PREDICT THE STOCK MARKET. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, SPORT MANAGERS COULD USE SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGICALLY TO BUILD BETTER RELATIONSHIPS WITH CONSUMERS AND STAKEHOLDERS."
"MCGRANE A, 2020, AM J MENS HEALTH";"THIS QUALITATIVE RESEARCH SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH THE IMPACT OF AN 8-WEEK PROGRAM COMBINING FOOTBALL AND ONE-TO-ONE PSYCHOTHERAPY ON YOUNG MALES' MENTAL HEALTH, DETERMINING THE FACTORS THAT PREDICT HELP-SEEKING BEHAVIORS IN THIS GROUP OF MEN. PRE- AND POST-PARTICIPATION FOCUS GROUPS WERE USED AS THE METHOD OF DATA COLLECTION. SIX MALES (19-35 YEARS OLD;M= 25.5) COMPLETED BOTH PRE-INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP FOCUS GROUPS. HELP-SEEKING BEHAVIORS WERE INFLUENCED BY THE APPEAL OF FOOTBALL AND THE PERCEPTION OF THE COUNSELOR BEING ACCESSIBLE. BARRIERS INCLUDED GENDER NORMS, SOCIALIZATION, FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, AND CHALLENGING SOCIAL LANDSCAPES. POST-PARTICIPATION FOCUS GROUPS REVEALED THAT POSITIVE SOCIAL AND COUNSELING RELATIONSHIPS FACILITATED IMPROVED MENTAL HEALTH. SPORT WAS DEEMED AN ACCEPTABLE MEDIUM TO DELIVER A MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTION AS IT INCREASED SOCIAL CONNECTIONS AND FACILITATED HELP-SEEKING.

"LOWERY B, 2020, J QUANT ANAL SPORTS";"IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT A NEW MODEL FOR RANKING SPORTS TEAMS. OUR MODEL USES ALL SCORING DATA FROM ALL GAMES TO PRODUCE A FUNCTIONAL RATING BY THE METHOD OF LEAST SQUARES. THE FUNCTIONAL RATING CAN BE INTERPRETED AS A TEAM AVERAGE POINT DIFFERENTIAL ADJUSTED FOR STRENGTH OF SCHEDULE. USING TWO TEAM'S FUNCTIONAL RATINGS WE CAN PREDICT THE EXPECTED POINT DIFFERENTIAL AT ANY TIME IN THE GAME. WE LOOKED AT THREE VARIATIONS OF OUR MODEL ACCOUNTING FOR HOME-COURT ADVANTAGE IN DIFFERENT WAYS. WE USE THE 2018-2019 NCAA DIVISION 1 MEN'S COLLEGE BASKETBALL SEASON TO TEST THE MODELS AND DETERMINED THAT HOME-COURT ADVANTAGE IS STATISTICALLY IMPORTANT BUT DOES NOT DIFFER BETWEEN TEAMS."
"WOO Y, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY";"THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF KOREAN BUSINESS GROUPS, CHAEBOLS, ON THE SPORTING PERFORMANCE OF THEIR AFFILIATED PROFESSIONAL SPORTS TEAMS USING GAME DATA FROM 1983 TO 2013. WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER OR NOT CHAEBOL OWNERSHIP OF PROFESSIONAL SPORTS TEAMS IS MORE EFFICIENT THAN NON-CHAEBOL OWNERSHIP IN ACHIEVING ATHLETIC SUCCESS ON THE FIELD OF PLAY. OUR EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOUND THAT THE CHAEBOL-AFFILIATED TEAMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE THE LEAGUE WINNERS OR FINALISTS THAN NON-CHAEBOL TEAMS ARE. WE ALSO TESTED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN THE WIDER ECONOMY THAT DEFLATES FIRM RESOURCES AND ATHLETIC OUTCOMES IN THE AFFILIATED TEAMS. IN THE TESTS, WHICH DIVIDE THE SAMPLE PERIOD INTO THREE 10-YEAR PERIODS, THE RESULTS OF TWO SUB-SAMPLES (1983-1993 AND 2004-2013) WERE IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS RESULTS. WE, HOWEVER, IDENTIFIED AN EXCEPTION WHEN CHAEBOL TEAMS DID NOT PLAY IN MORE FINAL MATCHES OF A LEAGUE BETWEEN 1994 AND 2003, THE TIME INTERVAL THAT INCLUDES THE PERIOD OF DRASTIC RESTRUCTURING OF BUSINESS GROUPS DURING THE 1997 ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS."

TAKING FOOTBALL AS THE RESEARCH SUBJECT, WE ANALYZE THE JOINT IMPACT OF MANAGERIAL HUMAN CAPITAL, MANAGERIAL SOCIAL CAPITAL, AND MANAGERIAL COGNITION WITHIN THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE CLUBS. WE RELY ON A UNIQUE 15-YEAR PANEL DATASET AND SHOW THAT MORE SPECIFIC MANAGERIAL HUMAN CAPITAL AND A LONG-TERM ORIENTATION AMONG THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASE RBD WHILE ADDITIONAL GENERAL MANAGERIAL HUMAN CAPITAL AND MANAGERIAL SOCIAL CAPITAL DIMINISH RBD. IN ADDITION, OUR FINDINGS REVEAL THAT DMCS MODERATE THE RELATIONSHIPS OF PHYSICAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES WITH RBD IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. OUR STUDY IS AMONGST THE FIRST TO ANALYZE ALL THREE UNDERPINNINGS OF DMCS AND TO ENDORSE THE PRACTICAL RELEVANCE OF DMCS FOR RBD."
"HAMMERSCHMIDT J, 2020, INT ENTREP MANAG J";"IN RECENT YEARS, SPORTS ENTREPRENEURSHIP HAS EMERGED AS A PROMISING DISCIPLINE IN THE FIELD OF SPORTS MANAGEMENT RESEARCH. HOWEVER, THE RESEARCH FIELD IS STILL FRAGMENTED. THIS STUDY GIVES AN OVERVIEW OF SPORTS ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND COOPETITION RESEARCH AND IS THE FIRST WORK ANALYZING EO AND PERFORMANCE IN PROFESSIONAL SPORTS. FIRST, QUANTITATIVE RESULTS ABOUT EO, ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND COOPETITION OF 22 PROFESSIONAL SOCCER CLUBS WERE OBTAINED. FOLLOWING THE MIXED METHOD APPROACH, THE DATA WAS THEN EXTENDED BY QUALITATIVE EXPERT INTERVIEWS. ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION HAD A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH FINANCIAL AND SPORTING PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL SOCCER CLUBS IN GERMAN-SPEAKING COUNTRIES DURING THE 2017/18 SEASON. WE SUGGEST COOPETITION AS A PROMISING STRATEGY FOR PROFESSIONAL SOCCER CLUBS TO SUCCEED. HENCE, OUR STUDY FOSTERS THE CONCEPT OF SPORTS ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND OFFERS EVIDENCE THAT ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION IS A WELL-SUITED MANAGERIAL APPROACH TO ENHANCE ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE IN PROFESSIONAL SOCCER."
"COATES D, 2020, INT J SPORT FINANC";"THIS STUDY CONSIDERS THE FOOTBALL TRANSFER MARKET AS A NETWORK AND ANALYZES HOW CHARACTERISTICS OF A FOOTBALL CLUB'S PLAYER TRANSFER NETWORK ACTIVITIES INFLUENCE CLUB PERFORMANCE. WE USE DATA ON 23,220 UNIQUE FOOTBALL CLUBS FROM 189 COUNTRIES FROM 1996 THROUGH 2016. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT FOR SPORT PERFORMANCE THE BEST STRATEGY IS TO HAVE WELL-ESTABLISHED RELATIONS WITH A LIMITED NUMBER OF PARTNER CLUBS, ESPECIALLY IN THE DOMESTIC LEAGUE. HOWEVER, TRANSFER POLICY FOCUSED ON INTERNATIONAL DEALS IMPROVES FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF FOOTBALL CLUBS. THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE CLUB MANAGEMENT WITH INSIGHTS ON OPTIMAL TRANSFER POLICY WITH REGARD TO THE BALANCE BETWEEN SPORT AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE."
"HOLZMAYER F, 2020, SPORT BUS MANAG";"PURPOSE PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL CLUBS HAVE INCREASINGLY INITIATED TWO CORPORATE DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGIES TO ENFOLD GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES BESIDES TRADITIONAL INCOME SOURCES: BUSINESS DIVERSIFICATION AND INTERNATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION. EMPIRICAL FINDINGS FROM MANAGEMENT AND SPORT MANAGEMENT LITERATURE PROVIDE INCONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE ON THESE STRATEGIES' FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE EFFECTS, NECESSITATING FURTHER RESEARCH. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS THEREFORE TO INVESTIGATE HOW BOTH CORPORATE DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGIES AFFECT THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL CLUBS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH A 15-YEAR PANEL DATA SET OF ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE (EPL) CLUBS IS EXAMINED, MANY OF WHICH HAVE EMPLOYED CORPORATE DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGIES. MEASURES FOR RELATED BUSINESS DIVERSIFICATION (RBD) AND UNRELATED BUSINESS DIVERSIFICATION (UBD) AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION ARE ESTABLISHED FROM MANAGEMENT LITERATURE. BASED ON FIXED EFFECTS REGRESSION MODELS, THEIR EFFECTS ON CLUBS' REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY ARE THEN EXAMINED. FINDINGS U-SHAPED EFFECTS FROM RBD ON REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY ARE FOUND, BUT NO EFFECTS FROM UBD. THESE FINDINGS EMPIRICALLY SUPPORT THE THEORETICALLY APPEALING SUPERIORITY OF RBD OVER UBD AND, WITH INCREASING LEVELS OF RBD, OVER A FOCUSED STRATEGY IN MANAGEMENT LITERATURE. WITH INTERNATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION, AN INVERTED U-SHAPED EFFECT ON REVENUES IS IDENTIFIED. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS DESPITE FOCUSING ONLY ON THE EPL, THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE OF NON-LINEAR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE EFFECTS FROM CORPORATE DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGIES ADDING TO (SPORT) MANAGEMENT LITERATURE AND SETTING THE STAGE FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ON THESE STRATEGIES IN PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL.

"LOMBARDI R, 2020, CORP SOC RESPONSIB ENVIRON MANAG";"CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY INVESTIGATED ASSUMING SEVERAL PERSPECTIVES. IN THIS SCENARIO, HUMAN RESOURCES AND PARTICULARLY EMPLOYEES ARE THE MOST RELEVANT GROUPS OF STAKEHOLDERS PLAYING A KEY ROLE IN ALL KIND OF ORGANIZATIONS. THUS, THIS PAPER AIMS AT INVESTIGATING THE PROFITABLE CONNECTION BETWEEN CSR AND HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (HRM). WE INVESTIGATE WHICH FACTORS DETERMINE RESPONSIBLE AND SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE EMPLOYEES' TYPOLOGY CONTRACTS GUARANTEEING CSR AND ITS PRINCIPLES. THE EMPLOYEES' CONTRACT TYPOLOGY IS RECOGNIZED AS A SUSTAINABLE KEY FACTOR IN INFLUENCING CORPORATE PERFORMANCE. THROUGH AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS IN THE FOOTBALL INDUSTRY, WE INVESTIGATE IF THE WORK CONTRACTS' AVERAGE DURATION BY FOOTBALL PLAYERS AFFECTS THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR CLUBS. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT ORGANIZATIONS ASSUMING STABILIZATION AND LONG TIMING IN THE EMPLOYEES' CONTRACT ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE ASSURING SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE PRACTICES AND CSR. THE AWARENESS OF THE EXISTENCE OF A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE DURATION OF THE CONTRACT AND THE COMPANY PERFORMANCE COULD BE EXPLOITED BY MANAGERS OF ALL ORGANIZATIONS IN IDENTIFYING THE OPTIMAL STRATEGY AND THE EFFECTIVENESS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CSR.

"KAPLANOVA A, 2020, FRONT PSYCHOL";"OBJECTIVE FINANCIAL AWARDS CAN BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR AFFECTING ATHLETES' MENTAL PREPARATION AND VARIOUS SKILLS TO MANAGE STRESS. SINCE SUCH A LINK HAS NOT YET BEEN STUDIED, THE STUDY HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE MODERATION EFFECT OF FINANCIAL AWARDS IN RELATION TO FOOTBALL PLAYERS' ANXIETY AND COPING SKILLS. METHODS THE STUDY CONSISTS OF 110 MALE FOOTBALL PLAYERS AGED 18-32 YEARS OLD (MEAN +/- SD: 23.98 +/- 3.01 YEARS) WHO WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: FINANCIAL AWARDED (N= 48) AND FINANCIAL UNAWARDED FOR SPORTS PERFORMANCE (N= 62). THE ANXIETY OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS WAS MEASURED BY THE SPORT ANXIETY SCALE SAS-2. COPING STRATEGIES TO MANAGE STRESS WERE ASSESSED BY THE ATHLETIC COPING SKILLS INVENTORY ACSI-28. THE EFFECT OF FINANCIAL AWARDS IN RELATION TO FOOTBALL PLAYERS' ANXIETY AND COPING SKILLS WAS EVALUATED BY THE MEDIATORS' MODEL USING THE PROCESS SOFTWARE (HAYES, 2018). RESULTS THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT FINANCIAL AWARDS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE FOOTBALL PLAYERS' ANXIETY AND COPING SKILLS. THE FINANCIAL AWARDS INCREASE THE MOTIVATION OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS TO BETTER PREPARE FOR SPORTS PERFORMANCE, WHICH HAS BEEN PROVEN, THROUGH BETTER SETTING OF PERFORMANCE GOALS AND MORE CAREFUL MENTAL PREPARATION. FINANCIALLY AWARDED FOOTBALL PLAYERS SEEM TO RESPECT THE COACH AND FOLLOW HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN UNAWARDED FOOTBALL PLAYERS, WHICH MAY BE DUE TO THE FINANCIAL BENEFITS AND THE COMMITMENT THEY HAVE CONFIRMED BY SIGNING TO THE FOOTBALL CLUB. IN ANOTHER ASPECT, THE FINANCIAL AWARDS ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE THE COGNITIVE TRAIT OF THE ANXIETY OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS. IT SEEMS THAT FINANCIAL PLAYERS ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FAILURE OF THE MATCH, WHICH INCREASES THEIR ANXIETY, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT IS A COGNITIVE PART AND AFFECTS THEIR SPORTS PERFORMANCE. CONCLUSION FOR THIS REASON, WE ENCOURAGE SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS TO FOCUS MORE ON THE MENTAL PREPARATION OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE FOOTBALL PLAYERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GRADUATE FROM SHORT- OR LONG-TERM MENTAL TRAINING CONDUCTED BY A TRAINED SPORTS PSYCHOLOGIST NOT ONLY AT THE TIME OF THE ATHLETE'S FAILURE BUT ALSO AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE AGAINST INCREASING COGNITIVE ANXIETY. WE RECOMMEND SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS TO TRAIN COACHES IN THE FIELD OF MENTAL TRAINING, PREFERABLY THROUGH ANNUAL SHORT TRAINING SESSIONS WITH A SPORTS PSYCHOLOGIST, TO INFLUENCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF DESIRABLE ATHLETES' COPING SKILLS."
"MORBEE S, 2020, SPORT PSYCHOL";"IN THIS STUDY, INVOLVING 585 YOUTH SPORT COACHES (M-AGE = 35.76), THE AUTHORS INVESTIGATED WHETHER COACHES WHO PERCEIVE THEIR ENVIRONMENT TO BE HIGHLY EVALUATIVE WOULD REPORT ACTING IN A MORE CONTROLLING OR PRESSURING WAY. IN A SUBSAMPLE (N = 211, M-AGE = 38.14), THEY EXAMINED THE EXPLANATORY ROLE OF COACHES' EXPERIENCES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL NEED FRUSTRATION IN THIS RELATION. THEY ALSO CONSIDERED WHETHER YEARS OF COACHING EXPERIENCE WOULD SERVE AS A BUFFER AGAINST THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF AN EVALUATIVE CONTEXT. IN LINE WITH THE TENETS OF SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY, RESULTS OF STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING INDICATED THAT AN EVALUATIVE CONTEXT WAS RELATED TO THE USE OF A MORE CONTROLLING COACHING STYLE, WITH EXPERIENCES OF NEED FRUSTRATION ACCOUNTING FOR THIS RELATION. COACHING EXPERIENCE DID NOT PLAY ANY MODERATING ROLE, SUGGESTING THAT EVEN MORE EXPERIENCED COACHES ARE VULNERABLE TO THE HARMFUL CORRELATES OF AN EVALUATIVE SPORT CONTEXT."

ELEVEN MALE PARTICIPANTS ON A TEAM FOR YOUTH REFUGEES PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. DATA COLLECTION WAS GUIDED BY A PHOTO ELICITATION ACTIVITY FOLLOWED BY SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS. BOTH THEMATIC ANALYSIS AND CREATIVE NONFICTION WERE EMPLOYED TO DEVELOP FINDINGS AND PRESENT A COMPOSITE VIGNETTE THAT STRIVES TO PROVIDE FINDINGS THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE, PROVOCATIVE, AND GIVE PRIVILEGE TO THE VOICE OF THE PARTICIPANTS. MOST NOTABLY, FINDINGS PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR TWO PROMINENT THEORIES OF SOC WITHIN THIS CONTEXT, AND HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF EMOTIONAL SAFETY, SHARED HISTORY, LEADERS AS ROLE MODELS, GRATITUDE, AND FUN. THE USE OF THE VIGNETTE TO PRESENT FINDINGS PROVIDES RESULTS IN A FORMAT THAT IS BOTH ACCESSIBLE TO PRACTITIONERS AND MAINTAINS THE VOICE OF THE YOUTH PARTICIPANTS. THE NATIONAL RECREATION AND PARK ASSOCIATION RECENTLY IDENTIFIED SERVICES FOR IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES AS KEY FOCUS AREAS (NRPA, 2018). FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY LED TO PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THAT ADDRESS THIS FOCUS AREA. BROADLY, SPORT PROGRAMS MAY PROVIDE A VALUABLE VENUE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROTECTIVE FACTORS SUCH AS A SOC FOR YOUTH REFUGEES. FURTHER, TEAMS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY FOR REFUGEES HELP FACILITATE THE EMOTIONAL SAFETY AND SHARED HISTORY NECESSARY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SOC. FINDINGS ALSO SUGGEST THAT REFUGEES FACE NUMEROUS ADDITIONAL BARRIERS THAT MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL AND PRACTICAL SUPPORT, INCLUDING TRANSPORTATION OR ASSISTANCE WITH FINDING PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT. AS SUCH, MANAGERS MAY WISH TO CONSIDER BUILDING PROGRAMS THAT FOLLOW A SPORT PLUS MODEL THAT ASSISTS PARTICIPANTS IN OTHER AREAS OF LIFE. FINALLY, FINDINGS POINT TO ANCILLARY SOCIAL SPACES THAT PROVIDE EMOTIONAL SAFETY AS KEY PARTS OF THE EXPERIENCE. THIS ALSO SUGGESTS THE NEED TO DEVELOP PROGRAMS THAT LEVERAGE THE COMMON INTERESTS OF SPORT INTO OTHER SOCIAL AREAS THAT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS."

THEREFORE, THE PURPOSES OF THIS STUDY WERE TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF EXERCISE AND ABUSE OF SYNTHETIC ANABOLIC STEROIDS AND FOOD SUPPLEMENTS ON MICRONUCLEI FREQUENCY IN BUCCAL CELLS AND 8-HYDROXY-2-DEOXYGUANOSINE (8-OHDG) AS MARKERS FOR DNA DAMAGE. METHODS: THE STUDY INCLUDED ONE HUNDRED MALES AGED 17-44 YEARS, DISTRIBUTED INTO FIVE DISTINCT GROUPS INCLUDING GROUP I: 20 BODYBUILDER INDIVIDUALS WITH AAS CONSUMPTION, GROUP II: 20 BODYBUILDER INDIVIDUALS WITH DIET SUPPLEMENT (PROTEINS) CONSUMPTION. GROUP III: 20 BODYBUILDERS WITHOUT AAS AND DIET SUPPLEMENT (PROTEINS) CONSUMPTION, GROUP IV: 20 FOOTBALL PLAYERS WITHOUT AAS AND PROTEINS CONSUMPTION, AND GROUP V 20 NON-ATHLETES WITHOUT DIET SUPPLEMENT OR AAS CONSUMPTION. RESULTS: THE MEAN AGE + STANDARD DEVIATION (SD) OF GROUPS I, II, III, IV AND V WERE (27.00 +/- 5.53, 27.85 +/- 5.60, 29.70 +/- 8.04, 22.35 +/ - 3.89 AND 26.05 +/- 6.42, RESPECTIVELY. THE MEAN OF BMI VALUES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AMONG GROUPS (P < .0001), BEING MUCH HIGHER FOR THE GROUP I (26.77 +/- 1.64) THAN FOR GROUP V (22.78 +/- 1.53***). NOTABLY, GROUP I AND II EXHIBITED ELEVATION IN 8-OHDG CONCENTRATION (3.19 +/- 0.35 AND 3.28 +/- 1.66, RESPECTIVELY) COMPARED TO THOSE FROM THE OTHER GROUPS, NOT BEING STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. IN ADDITION NO STATICALLY DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED ACCORDING TO FREQUENCY OF MICRONUCLEI IN BUCCAL CELLS.

"VALENTI M, 2020, EUR SPORT MANAG Q";"RESEARCH QUESTION:WHILE NATIONAL SPORTING GOVERNING BODIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAMMES WHICH SEEK TO ENHANCE THEIR INTERNATIONAL SPORTING SUCCESS, COMPARATIVE STUDIES ON ELITE SPORT POLICIES HAVE PROVIDED LIMITED EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SUCH PROGRAMMES AND THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SPORTING OUTCOMES. FOLLOWING THE SPLISS FRAMEWORK, THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE LONGITUDINAL IMPACT OF FOUR PROGRAMME-LEVEL FACTORS - FINANCIAL SUPPORT, HUMAN RESOURCES, COACHING PROVISION AND FOUNDATION PHASE ACTIVITY - ON THE INTERNATIONAL SUCCESS OF WOMEN'S NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAMS. RESEARCH METHODS:DATA FROM 55 UNION OF EUROPEAN FOOTBALL ASSOCIATIONS' (UEFA) MEMBERS WERE COLLECTED OVER A SEVEN-YEAR-PERIOD (2011-2017). THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PROGRAMME-LEVEL FACTORS AND FIFA RANKING POINTS ARE VERIFIED THROUGH PANEL REGRESSION ANALYSES. CONTROLS FOR ECONOMIC, TALENT POOL, POLITICAL, SOCIO-CULTURAL, CLIMATE AND MEN'S FOOTBALL LEGACY VARIABLES ARE INCLUDED. RESULTS AND FINDINGS:THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT HIGHLY SPECIALISED COACHING PROVISION HAS A SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE IMPACT ON INTERNATIONAL SUCCESS IN WOMEN'S FOOTBALL, WHILE OUR PROXIES FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT, HUMAN RESOURCES AND FOUNDATION PHASE ACTIVITY HAVE NO NOTABLE EXPLANATORY POWER FOR THE SUCCESS OF WOMEN'S NATIONAL TEAMS.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIRTEEN YEARS OF TICKET REVENUE AND FOOTBALL ATTENDANCE DATA WERE COLLECTED FOR NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION (NCAA) FOOTBALL BOWL SUBDIVISION (FBS) DIVISION I ATHLETICS DEPARTMENTS (N = 126), AS WELL AS DATA ON WHETHER THE ORGANIZATION EMPLOYED AN EXTERNAL (OUTSOURCED), INTERNAL OR NO TICKET SALES FORCE. THE NUMBER OF SALESPEOPLE EMPLOYED WAS ALSO CAPTURED. WITHIN-SUBJECTS, FIXED EFFECTS REGRESSION MODELS, WHICH INCLUDED SEVERAL CONTROL VARIABLES SUCH AS NUMBER OF HOME CONTESTS, PRIOR SEASON ATTENDANCE, TEAM SUCCESS AND POPULATION, WERE RUN TO ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SALES FORCE TYPE AND BOTH TICKET REVENUE AND ATTENDANCE, FOR ONE YEAR, TWO YEARS AND THREE YEARS AFTER SALES FORCE ESTABLISHMENT. FINDINGS ALL MODELS WERE SIGNIFICANT. WHILE BOTH INTERNALLY MANAGED TICKET SALES FORCES AND THOSE MANAGED BY OUTSOURCED FIRMS SAW SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN TICKET REVENUE (COMPARED TO NOT EMPLOYING A SALES FORCE), INTERNALLY MANAGED DEPARTMENTS OUTPERFORMED THIRD PARTIES. IN ADDITION, DEPARTMENTS UTILIZING OUTSOURCING COMPANIES REPORTED LOWER ATTENDANCE FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS AFTER OUTSOURCING, BUT ATTENDANCE DIFFERENCES WERE NEGLIGIBLE BY THE THIRD YEAR OF OUTSOURCING. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY PROVIDE DATA TO HELP SPORT MANAGERS DETERMINE WHETHER OUTSOURCING SALES FUNCTIONS WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION WILL LEAD TO GREATER TICKET REVENUE AND/OR ATTENDANCE.

HOWEVER, REFERENCE VALUES FROM THIS LEVEL OF PLAY ARE LARGELY LACKING. METHODS:WE THEREFORE REPORT A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE BLOOD-BORNE FATIGUE MARKERS CREATINE KINASE (CK) AND UREA (U) FROM THE GERMAN NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM DURING THE FIFA WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS AND UEFA EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS FROM 2006-2016. VALUES FROM 68 PLAYERS COULD BE ANALYSED RESULTING IN 1019 VALUES FOR CK AND 943 VALUES FOR U. FOR 2014 AND 2016, ADDITIONAL PLAYER TRACKING DATA WERE AVAILABLE. RESULTS:MEAN VALUES (90\% CI) FOR CK AND U WERE 343.4 (333.3-353.6) U/L AND 39.5 (39.0-39.9) MG/DL, RESPECTIVELY. CONSIDERABLE BETWEEN-SUBJECT VARIATION WAS PRESENT ACCOUNTING FOR 44\% OF RANDOM VARIABILITY FOR LOGCK AND 45\% FOR LOGU. A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE OVER TIME (P < 0.001) COULD BE OBSERVED FOR BOTH INDICATORS. TOTAL RUNNING DISTANCE AND HIGH-SPEED RUNNING WERE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH CK LEVELS 2 DAYS AFTER THE MATCH WITH A DISPROPORTIONATE CK RESPONSE FOR OVERTIME MATCHES. CONCLUSION:TAKEN TOGETHER, MONITORING OF RECOVERY NEEDS IN ELITE FOOTBALL IS LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM INDIVIDUALIZED REFERENCE VALUES. WHEN GROUP-BASED REFERENCE RANGES ARE USED, THEY SHOULD BE CURRENT AND FOOTBALL-SPECIFIC."

AFTER MORE THAN TWO DECADES OF DEVELOPMENT, CHINA'S FOOTBALL INDUSTRY HAS BECOME MORE ECONOMICALLY INDEPENDENT OF GOVERNMENT, THOUGH THE INDUSTRY STILL FACES A SERIES OF PROBLEMS AND DILEMMAS. THESE PROBLEMS INCLUDE A POOR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM; THE ON-GOING FINANCIAL DEFICITS OF ITS FOOTBALL CLUBS; INADEQUATE MARKET EXPANSION; THE FOOTBALL BUBBLE ECONOMY PHENOMENON; AND THE ABSENCE OF A BRAND CULTURE FOR THE FOOTBALL CLUBS.

METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE CHART REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED AT TWO NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION DIVISION I UNIVERSITIES. PARTICIPANTS WERE STUDENT-ATHLETES DURING THE 2010/11-2018/19 ACADEMIC YEARS. THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE WAS SCT STATUS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED ACTUAL PREVALENCE OF SCT POSITIVE STUDENT-ATHLETES, SEX, RACE, SPORT, PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF PERSONAL AND FAMILY HISTORY SCT STATUS, AND HB PROFILE (HBA, HBA2, HBS, HBF, HBC) PROPORTIONS. RESULTS: FIFTY-THREE SCT POSITIVE STUDENT-ATHLETES (13.2 +/- 2.0 PER ACADEMIC YEAR) WERE IDENTIFIED, ACCOUNTING FOR SIMILAR TO 1\% OF THE STUDENT-ATHLETE POPULATION ANNUALLY. THE MAJORITY WERE BLACK/AFRICAN-AMERICAN (N = 49, 100.0\%; 4 MISSING) AND MALES (N = 44, 83.0\%). FOOTBALL HAD THE MAJORITY (N = 28, 52.8\%) OF SCT STUDENT-ATHLETES. MOST STUDENT-ATHLETES WERE UNAWARE OF THEIR SCT STATUS (N = 33, 62.3\%). THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACTUAL AND EXPECTED PREVALENCE OF SCT STUDENT-ATHLETES OVERALL AND BY RACE IN ANY ACADEMIC YEAR (P > 0.05). RESULTS OF HB ELECTROPHORESIS TESTING WERE AVAILABLE FOR 44 (83.0\%) STUDENT-ATHLETES. AVERAGE VALUES FOR HBA, HBA2, HBS, HBF AND HBC WERE 58.54 +/- 4.26\%, 3.42 +/- 0.53\%, 37.99 +/- 4.60\%, 0.17 +/- 0.68\% AND 0.00 +/- 0.00\%, RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSIONS: STUDENT-ATHLETES WITH SCT WERE A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE STUDENT-ATHLETE POPULATION. THE MAJORITY OF SCT STUDENT-ATHLETES HAD NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF PERSONAL OR FAMILY HISTORY; THEREFORE, IT IS INSUFFICIENT TO RELY ON SELF-REPORTED HISTORY. NO DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND BETWEEN ACTUAL AND EXPECTED PREVALENCE OF SCT STUDENT-ATHLETES. DUE TO HIGH PROPORTION OF STUDENT-ATHLETES WHO ARE UNAWARE OF THEIR SCT STATUS, INSTITUTIONS SHOULD FACILITATE SCT SCREENING WITH CONFIRMATORY TESTING FOR ALL STUDENT-ATHLETES TO PREVENT MISSED IDENTIFICATION OF THOSE WITH SCT."

WE FIND EVIDENCE THAT THE SCORELINE PROBABILITY FORECASTS FROM THE MODEL ARE BETTER THAN WHAT THE ODDS OF BOOKMAKERS IMPLY, BASED ON FORECAST ENCOMPASSING REGRESSIONS. HOWEVER, WHEN WE APPLY A SIMPLE BETTING STRATEGY USING POINT FORECASTS FROM THE MODEL, THERE ARE NO SUBSTANTIAL OR CONSISTENT FINANCIAL RETURNS TO BE MADE OVER THE TWO SEASONS.

DRAWING FROM POLICY DOCUMENTATION AND INTERVIEW DATA, THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE PRECIPITATING FACTORS THAT UNDERPIN LARGE-SCALE MATCH-FIXING IN SOUTH KOREA. THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS REVEAL THAT FIRST, THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE LEGAL, MONOPOLY BETTING OPERATOR ATTRACTS MATCH-FIXERS FOR MANIPULATION DUE TO ITS GUARANTEED PAYOUTS. SECOND, THE LEGAL BETTING SYSTEM THAT ONLY OFFERS TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS (E.G., FINAL MATCH RESULTS) REQUIRED FIXERS TO MOBILIZE A LARGER NUMBER OF PLAYERS, INCREASING THE SIZE OF THE SCANDAL. THIRD, WITHIN THE SMALL COMMUNITY OF FOOTBALLERS, THE NETWORKS BASED ON SCHOOL TIES, AND THE TRAINING CAMP CULTURE MADE IT EASIER FOR FIXERS WITH SOCCER-PLAYING BACKGROUNDS TO MOBILIZE MANY ACTIVE PLAYERS. FINALLY, THE FOLLOW-UP MEASURES AFTER THE SCANDAL ONLY TARGETED ILLEGAL BETTING OPERATORS OR INDIVIDUAL PLAYER IMMORALITY, WHICH ALLOWED THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE TO PLAY A DUAL ROLE AS BOTH THE OPERATOR OF THE SPORTS GAMBLING BUSINESS AND THE PROTECTOR OF SPORT INTEGRITY."
"ERTURAN-OGUT EE, 2020, INT J SPORT POLICY POLIT";"LAUNCHED IN 2014 IN TURKEY, THE PASSOLIG E-TICKETING CARD HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF COMMODIFYING FOOTBALL FANS, FAVOURING THE RULING-CLASS, AND BEING AN AUTHORITARIAN STATE TOOL TO PROTECT STADIUMS FROM INCREASING POLITICAL OPPOSITION. THIS CRITICISM RECALLS THE PRACTICE OF NEOLIBERALISM. THEREFORE, THE STUDY POSES THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: ACCORDING TO THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF FAN OPINIONS, IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE OF NEOLIBERAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE PASSOLIG? WITH AN ANALYTICAL DISCUSSION ON THE AXIS OF NEOLIBERALISM, THE STUDY ARGUES THAT TURKISH FOOTBALL HAS BEEN WOVEN INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEOLIBERALISM IN THE COUNTRY. DATA FROM FOCUS GROUP INTERVIEWS ALSO SHOW CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT THE PASSOLIG SYSTEM INVOLVES NEOLIBERALISM, BOTH IN ECONOMIC AND SOCIO-POLITICAL TERMS. FAN OPINIONS ARE ALIGNED WITH THE NEOLIBERAL OUTCOMES OF THE PASSOLIG: THE FINANCIAL SECTOR WAS STRENGTHENED THROUGH THE CREATION OF NEW BANK CUSTOMERS AND NEW TRANSACTIONS, AND COMMODIFIED FANS HAVE TURNED INTO OVERSPENDING FOOTBALL CONSUMERS; THEREFORE, A MORE COMMERCIALIZED FOOTBALL MARKET IN THE COMPETITIVE GLOBAL FOOTBALL SPHERE HAS DEVELOPED. MOST OF THE FANS EVALUATE THE NEW SYSTEM AS A TOOL FOR BLACKLISTING OPPOSING FANS AND REDUCING STADIUM PROTESTS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. THESE FAN OPINIONS ALIGN WITH THE CONCEPT OF AUTHORITARIAN NEOLIBERALISM, AS THE EMERGING LITERATURE SUGGESTS. THE DATA ALSO SHOW THAT THE PASSOLIG CAN BE CONSIDERED A TOOL FOR THE GENTRIFICATION OF THE FAN PROFILE, WHICH IS NOW MORE CONTROLLED BY THE AUTHORITARIAN NEOLIBERAL STATE."

IN CONTRAST, THE EFFECT OF A SINGLE PLAYER'S INJURY OR ONE PLAYER'S ABSENCE IN TEAM SPORTS IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY, BOTH FROM THE PERFORMANCE PERSPECTIVE AND THE FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE.OBJECTIVESIN THIS STUDY, WE ATTEMPTED TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECT OF INJURIES ON THE PERFORMANCE OF FOOTBALL TEAMS FROM THE ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE (EPL), AND THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS DERIVED FROM THIS EFFECT.METHODSOUR ANALYSIS IS BASED ON DATA REGARDING GAME RESULTS, INJURIES AND ESTIMATIONS OF THE PLAYERS' FINANCIAL VALUE FOR THE 2012-2013 THROUGH THE 2016-2017 SEASONS.RESULTSWE FOUND A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP (R=-0.46, 95\% CI -0.6 TO -0.28, P=0.001) BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF DAYS OUT DUE TO INJURIES SUFFERED BY TEAM MEMBERS DURING A SEASON AND THE PLACE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR ACTUAL AND EXPECTED FINISH IN THE EPL TABLE (ACCORDING TO OVERALL PLAYER VALUE). MOREOVER, WE CAN INTERPOLATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 136 DAYS OUT DUE TO INJURY CAUSES A TEAM THE LOSS OF ONE LEAGUE POINT, AND THAT APPROXIMATELY 271 DAYS OUT DUE TO INJURY COSTS A TEAM ONE PLACE IN THE TABLE. THIS INTERPOLATION FORMULA IS USED AS A HEURISTIC MODEL, AND GIVEN THE RELATIONSHIP SPECIFIED ABOVE ACCOUNTS FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE VARIANCE IN LEAGUE PLACEMENT (21\%), THE REMAINING VARIANCE IS RELATED TO OTHER FACTORS. CALCULATING THE COSTS OF WAGE BILLS AND PRIZE MONEY, WE ESTIMATE THAT AN EPL TEAM LOSES AN AVERAGE OF 45MILLION STERLING DUE TO INJURY-RELATED DECREMENT IN PERFORMANCE PER SEASON.CONCLUSIONPROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL CLUBS HAVE A STRONG ECONOMIC INCENTIVE TO INVEST IN INJURY PREVENTION AND REHABILITATION PROGRAMMES."

"CARLOS SANCHEZ L, 2020, EUR RES MANAG BUS ECON";"THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROFITABILITY AND SPORTING PERFORMANCE IN EUROPEAN FOOTBALL. PROFITABILITY HAS BEEN RARELY STUDIED BECAUSE IT HAS NOT BEEN CONSIDERED AN AIM OF EUROPEAN CLUBS, IN CONTRAST WITH AMERICAN CLUBS. HOWEVER, THE EMERGENCE OF INVESTORS WHO INVEST ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC SHOWS THAT THE OBJECTIVES OF OWNERS CAN BE DIVERSE AND THAT PROFITABILITY HAS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. THE STUDY OF THE COMPATIBILITY OR INCOMPATIBILITY OF SPORTING PERFORMANCE AND PROFITABILITY HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF CLUBS WITH OWNERS WITH DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES IN THE SAME COMPETITION, OR EVEN OWNERS WITH DIFFERENT AIMS IN THE SAME CLUB. THE PAPER FINDS THAT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE HAS A NEGATIVE INFLUENCE ON CLUBS' SPORTING PERFORMANCE, WHILE SPORTING PERFORMANCE DOES NOT HAVE A NEGATIVE INFLUENCE ON PROFITABILITY. MOREOVER, OWNERSHIP CONCENTRATION HAS A NEGATIVE INFLUENCE ON BOTH PERFORMANCE VARIABLES.

WITH VERY FEW CASES REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE, THESE INJURIES ARE OFTEN MISDIAGNOSED AND IMAGING IS NOT ALWAYS CLEAR, THUS MAKING PHYSICIANS OFTEN UNAWARE OF THEM. THE PRESENT CASE REPORT AIMS TO INVESTIGATE A RARE CASE INVOLVING A CLAVICULAR SALTER-HARRIS II FRACTURE WITH ASSOCIATED POSTERIOR DISPLACEMENT OF THE DIAPHYSIS, A TERM COINED A ``PSEUDODISLOCATION.'' PATIENT CONCERNS: WE PRESENT A CASE OF A 14-YEAR-OLD ADOLESCENT WHO SUSTAINED A TRAUMATIC INJURY TO THE SHOULDER WHILE FALLING DURING A SOCCER MATCH. HIS MAIN CONCERN WAS ABOUT RECOVERY TIME AND THE RETURN TO DAILY LIFE ACTIVITIES. DIAGNOSES: MULTIPLE IMAGING STUDIES IMAGING (X-RAYS, COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY, MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING) REVEALED A SALTER-HARRIS II FRACTURE OF THE RIGHT CLAVICLE WITH POSTERIOR DISPLACEMENT OF THE DIAPHYSIS. INTERVENTIONS: THE PATIENT UNDERWENT PRIMARY SURGERY TO REDUCE THE FRACTURE, USING AN ARTICULAR LOCKING COMPRESSION PLATE, AND SECONDARY SURGERY TO REMOVE THE HARDWARE. OUTCOMES: FOLLOWING THE REMOVAL OF THE HARDWARE AT 60 DAYS AFTER THE INITIAL SURGERY AND A NUMBER OF CYCLES OF PHYSIOTHERAPY THE PATIENT REPORTED A PAIN-FREE RANGE OF MOTION WITH SLIGHT LIMITATION AT EXTREMES. FULL RETURN TO RECREATIONAL AND EVERYDAY LIFE ACTIVITIES WERE ACHIEVED AT 3 MONTHS FROM THE INITIAL SURGERY. LESSONS: THE PSCJDS ARE CHALLENGING INJURIES, AS THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY DELICATE STRUCTURES INSIDE THE MEDIASTINUM. ATTENTION MUST BE TAKEN WHILE DIAGNOSING AND TREATING THESE INJURIES AS THE RISK OF COMPLICATIONS AND IATROGENIC INJURIES IS HIGH.

IN PARTICULAR, WE ANALYSED THE IMPACT THAT THE INCOME STATEMENT, NET EQUITY AND TEAM VALUE VARIABLES HAVE ON THE POINTS ACHIEVED BY FOOTBALL TEAMS PLAYING IN ``SERIE A'' CHAMPIONSHIP (ITALIAN LEAGUE). THE METHOD USED IN OUR STUDY IS A GENERALIZED ESTIMATING EQUATION (GEE) FOR LONGITUDINAL COUNT DATA. IN ADDITION WE CONSIDER A COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION IN THE GEE APPROACH BASED ON WALD STATISTICS, AND WE PROPOSE A MODIFIED MALLOW'S CP FOR CHOOSING THE BEST MODEL. FINALLY WE PROPOSE AN AFRSPORT INDEX BASED ON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OBSERVED AND THEORETICAL POINTS, IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THOSE TEAMS THAT EFFICIENTLY EMPLOY THEIR FINANCIAL RESOURCES."
"FULLAGAR HHK, 2019, J STRENGTH COND RES";"PRACTITIONERS' PERCEPTIONS REGARDING THE USE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF RESEARCH EVIDENCE IN SPORT IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE PRACTITIONERS' PERCEPTIONS AROUND THE USE, IMPLEMENTATION, AND BARRIERS TO EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE (EBP) IN SPORT SCIENCE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (USA). A SURVEY (28 ITEMS) WAS COMPLETED BY 67 FULL-TIME STAFF WHO WERE A PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE TEAM MEMBER EMPLOYED BY UNIVERSITIES OR PROFESSIONAL SPORTING ORGANIZATIONS IN THE USA. QUESTIONS INCLUDED THE USE OF RESEARCH, CONTRIBUTION OF RESEARCH AREAS, BARRIERS TO ACCESSING AND IMPLEMENTING EBP, AND METHODS OF FEEDBACK TO THE COACH AND PLAYERS. ALL RESPONDENTS (100\%) STATED THEY USED RESEARCH EVIDENCE IN THEIR PERFORMANCE/TRAINING PROGRAM, RANKING RESEARCH AS CONTRIBUTING MOST (LARGEST CONTRIBUTION = 1 TO SMALLEST CONTRIBUTION = 4) TO INDIVIDUALIZED PREPARATION OR RECOVERY RECOMMENDATIONS (1.98 +/- 1.02). THE TOP 3 PREFERRED SOURCES OF INFORMATION WERE ``PEER-REVIEWED RESEARCH'' (100\% OF RESPONDENTS), ``CONFERENCES/SEMINARS'' (76\%), AND ``PRACTITIONERS WITHIN YOUR SPORT'' (63\%). COMMONLY REPORTED PERCEIVED BARRIERS BETWEEN ACCESSING AND IMPLEMENTING RESEARCH WERE ``LACK OF STAFF'' (ACCESSING = 33\%, IMPLEMENTING = 46\%) ``TIME'' (ACCESSING = 38\%, IMPLEMENTING = 48\%) AND NONAPPLICABLE RESEARCH (ACCESSING = 33\%, IMPLEMENTING = 37\%), WHEREAS ``POOR PLAYER COMPLIANCE'' WAS A CLEAR BARRIER TO IMPLEMENTING EBP (56\%). PRACTITIONERS MOST PREFERRED, AND ACTUAL, METHOD OF FEEDBACK FOR COACHING STAFF (87\% FOR BOTH) AND PLAYERS (94 AND 95\%, RESPECTIVELY) WAS ``INFORMAL CONVERSATIONS/SPEAKING.'' IMPROVED ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES, INCREASED INTEGRATION OF STAFF IN COACH SETTINGS AND UNDERSTANDING OF PLAYER/COACH CONTEXTS MAY HELP TO ALLEVIATE BARRIERS TO EBP."
"HUTH C, 2020, EUR SPORT MANAG Q";"RESEARCH QUESTION: DUE TO THE REINFORCED CONDITIONS OF OFFICIAL REGULATORY CREDIT SCREENING PROCEDURES OF BASEL II AND BASEL III, CREDIT IS NOW MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FOR RISKY BUSINESS MODELS SUCH AS SPORT CLUBS. THEREFORE, ALTERNATIVE, SUPPORTER-BASED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HAVE BECOME MORE IMPORTANT. THE AIM OF THE STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE PURCHASE DECISION OF ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OF FOOTBALL CLUBS. RESEARCH METHODS: WE USED A STANDARDIZED ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE TO TRACK FINANCE-RELATED, CLUB ATTACHMENT-RELATED AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS THAT DESCRIBE POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL EUROPEAN INVESTORS IN SUPPORTER-BASED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. IN TOTAL, 760 RESPONDENTS COMPLETELY FILLED OUT THE QUESTIONNAIRES. RESULTS AND FINDINGS: OUR BIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIATE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT CLUB ATTACHMENT IS ESSENTIAL FOR AN INVESTMENT IN A FOOTBALL CLUB. THE RESULTS ALSO UNDERLINE THAT TRADITIONAL INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES ARE MORE OR LESS IRRELEVANT FOR SUPPORTER-INVOLVED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS."
"KOCH N, 2020, SPORT ETHICS PHILOS";"THE NAMES OF TWO MAJOR GULF AIRLINES, QATAR AIRWAYS AND EMIRATES, HAVE SATURATED THE EUROPEAN FOOTBALL SCENE FOR MANY YEARS, SPONSORING SOME OF THE MOST PROMINENT EUROPEAN TEAMS AND FIFA ITSELF. THESE STATE-BACKED AIRLINES ARE ALSO ACTIVE IN MOTORSPORTS, RUGBY, CYCLING, TENNIS, GOLF, CRICKET, AND EQUESTRIAN SPORT, WHILE SEVERAL PROMINENT GULF ELITES AND ROYAL FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE RECENTLY TAKEN OVER MAJOR SPORTS FRANCHISES IN EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE. HOW SHOULD WE UNDERSTAND THESE FAR-REACHING SPONSORSHIP AGENDAS IN THE GULF? WHAT CAN THEY TELL US ABOUT THE POLITICS AND ETHICS OF INTERNATIONAL SPORT ON THE ARABIAN PENINSULA? MOVING BEYOND THE GENERAL READINGS OF GULF SPORT SPONSORSHIP AS AN EXERCISE IN ?SOFT POWER,? THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW THESE DEALS ARE STRATEGIC NODES FOR DIVERSE ACTORS IN THE GULF AND IN THE INTERNATIONAL SPORTING COMMUNITY TO ADVANCE VARIOUS INTERESTS: PERSONAL, POLITICAL, FINANCIAL, AND OTHERWISE. INFORMED BY A CRITICAL GEOPOLITICS LENS THAT QUESTIONS THE COHERENCE OF THE ?STATE? AS AN ACTOR, I ASK WHAT IT MEANS TO SAY THAT ?THE GULF?

"SHABIR A, 2019, NUTRIENTS";"CAFFEINE (CAF) HAS BEEN REPORTED TO IMPROVE VARIOUS FACETS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCCESSFUL SOCCER PLAY, INCLUDING GROSS MOTOR SKILL PERFORMANCE, ENDURANCE CAPACITY AND COGNITION. THESE BENEFITS ARE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO PHARMACOLOGICAL MECHANISMS. HOWEVER, EVIDENCE ASSESSING CAF'S OVERALL EFFECTS ON SOCCER PERFORMANCE ARE SPARSE WITH NO STUDIES ACCOUNTING FOR CAF'S POTENTIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT. THEREFORE, THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS CAF'S PSYCHOLOGICAL VS. PHARMACOLOGICAL INFLUENCE ON VARIOUS FACETS OF SIMULATED SOCCER PERFORMANCE. UTILISING A DOUBLE-DISSOCIATION DESIGN, EIGHT MALE RECREATIONAL SOCCER PLAYERS (AGE: 22 +/- 5 YEARS, BODY MASS: 78 +/- 16 KG, HEIGHT: 178 +/- 6 CM) CONSUMED CAF (3 MG/KG/BODY MASS) OR PLACEBO (PLA) CAPSULES, 60 MIN PRIOR TO PERFORMING THE LOUGHBOROUGH INTERMITTENT SHUTTLE TEST (LIST) INTERSPERSED WITH A COLLECTION OF RATINGS OF PERCEIVED EXERTION (RPE), BLOOD GLUCOSE AND LACTATE, HEART RATE AND PERFORMING THE LOUGHBOROUGH SOCCER PASSING TEST (LSPT). WHOLE-BODY DYNAMIC REACTION TIME (DRT) WAS ASSESSED PRE- AND POST- LIST, AND ENDURANCE CAPACITY (T-LIM) POST, TIME-MATCHED LIST. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING IBM SPSS (V24) WHILST SUBJECTIVE PERCEPTIONS WERE EXPLORED USING TEMPLATE ANALYSIS. MEAN T-LIM WAS GREATEST (P < 0.001) FOR SYNERGISM (GIVEN CAF/TOLD CAF) (672 +/- 132 S) VS. PLACEBO (GIVEN PLA/TOLD PLA) (533 +/ - 79 S). HOWEVER, WHEN ISOLATED, T-LIM WAS GREATER (P = 0.012) FOR CAF PSYCHOLOGY (GIVEN PLA/TOLD CAF) (623 +/- 117 S) VS. PHARMACOLOGY (GIVEN CAF/TOLD PLA) (578 +/- 99 S), POTENTIALLY, VIA REDUCED RPE. ALTHOUGH DRT PERFORMANCE WAS GREATER (P = 0.024) POST-INGESTION (+5 HITS) AND POST-EXERCISE (+7 HITS) FOR PHARMACOLOGY VS. PLACEBO, PSYCHOLOGY AND SYNERGISM APPEARED TO IMPROVE LSPT PERFORMANCE VS. PHARMACOLOGY. INTERESTINGLY, POSITIVE PERCEPTIONS DURING PSYCHOLOGY INHIBITED LSPT AND DRT PERFORMANCE VIA POTENTIAL CAF OVER-RELIANCE, WITH THE OPPOSITE OCCURRING FOLLOWING NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS. THE BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH CAF EXPECTANCIES MAY BETTER SUIT TASKS THAT ENTAIL LESSER COGNITIVE-/SKILL-SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES BUT GREATER GROSS MOTOR FUNCTION AND THIS IS LIKELY DUE TO REDUCED RPE. IN ISOLATION, THESE EFFECTS APPEAR GREATER VS. CAF PHARMACOLOGY. HOWEVER, AN ADDITIVE BENEFIT MAY BE OBSERVED AFTER COMBINING EXPECTANCY WITH CAF PHARMACOLOGY (I.E., SYNERGISM)."

COMBINING THE CONCEPTS OF ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY AND INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ENGAGEMENT OF VOLUNTARY SPORTS CLUBS (VSCS) IN THE PROCESS OF REFUGEE INTEGRATION. DRAWING ON DATA FROM A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF N = 5,170 GERMAN VSCS THROUGH AN ONLINE SURVEY, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT 28\% OF THE VSCS REPORTED ENGAGEMENT IN THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATING REFUGEES BY THE END OF 2015; HOWEVER, ONLY 14\% INITIATED CONCRETE MEASURES. THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS THE RELEVANCE OF INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS. VSCS ARE ENCOURAGED TO CAREFULLY HANDLE THE TENSION BETWEEN BUSINESS-LIKE MANAGEMENT AND INTENSIVE VOLUNTARY WORK DURING THE INTEGRATIVE PROCESS. FINANCIAL CAPACITY APPEARS LESS RELEVANT; THE PRESENCE OF MIGRANT CLUB MEMBERS AND A MORE PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONAL DESIGN, HOWEVER, APPEAR BENEFICIAL. THE RESULTS IMPLY THAT INVOLVED STAKEHOLDERS SHOULD INTENSIFY CAPACITY BUILDING PROGRAMS IN THE STRUCTURAL DIMENSION OF ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY."
"EVANS R, 2019, ACCOUNT AUDIT ACCOUNT";"PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO PROVIDE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SALARY COST MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL, A FORM OF FINANCIAL REGULATION INTRODUCED BY THE ENGLISH FOOTBALL LEAGUE IN 2004 TO IMPROVE THE FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY OF PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL (I.E. SOCCER) CLUBS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE ANALYTICAL APPROACH IS TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF THE REGULATION FROM EVIDENCE OF CHANGE IN MEASURES OF THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF CLUBS DRAWING ON THREE CRITERIA: PROFITABILITY, LIQUIDITY AND SOLVENCY. A UNIQUE DATABASE WAS CREATED FROM THE PUBLISHED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS OF THE CLUBS IN THE TIER 4 LEAGUE (KNOWN SINCE 2004 AS LEAGUE TWO) FROM 1994 TO 2014 TO ENCAPSULATE THE 10-YEAR PERIOD BEFORE AND AFTER THE REGULATION WAS INTRODUCED. TO SHOW TRENDS IN THE DATA WITHIN THE STUDY PERIOD, THE DATA ARE REPORTED IN GRAPHICAL FORM. THE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF CHANGE IN BOTH THE SLOPE AND INTERCEPTS FOR TRENDS BETWEEN BREAKS OF INTEREST IN THE DATA IS ESTIMATED BY LINEAR REGRESSION. FINDINGS THE RESULTS SHOW THAT FINANCIAL REGULATION FAILED TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE PROFITABILITY OR THE SOLVENCY OF FOOTBALL CLUBS IN LEAGUE TWO. WHILST THE LIQUIDITY OF THE CLUBS IMPROVED IN RESPONSE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE FINANCIAL REGULATION, THE RESULTS SHOW THIS WAS ONLY IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE FINANCIAL REGULATION WAS INTRODUCED. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL REGULATION FOR FOOTBALL LEAGUE CLUBS OVER A LONGITUDINAL PERIOD. IT IS ALSO EXTENDS PREVIOUS RESEARCH IN WHICH ONLY SINGLE ASPECTS OF THE FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY OF FOOTBALL CLUBS, SUCH AS INSOLVENCY, HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED."

"DA SILVA NO, 2019, CONTAB GEST GOV";"OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EVALUATE THE LEVEL OF MANDATORY DISCLOSURE OF BRAZILIAN SOCCER CLUBS IN ORDER TO VERIFY THE EXISTENCE OF A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ACCOUNTING DISCLOSURE, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND THE CLUBS' SPORTING PERFORMANCE. METHOD: WE EMPLOY A QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH METHOD BY EMPIRICALLY DEVELOPING A DISCLOSURE INDEX. THE DATA WERE COLLECTED ON THE WEBSITES OF SOCCER CLUBS AND THEIR FEDERATIONS. THE SAMPLE IS COMPOSED OF 76 BRAZILIAN SOCCER CLUBS BELONGING TO THE RANKING LIST OF THE BRAZILIAN FOOTBALL CONFEDERATION. A MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION ALLOWED INVESTIGATING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MAIN VARIABLES OF THE STUDY. ORIGINALITY/RELEVANCE: THE WORK CONTRIBUTES TO A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SOCCER PERFORMANCE AND THE CONFORMITY OF THE RECOGNITION, MEASUREMENT, AND DISCLOSURE OF THE ACCOUNTING ACTS AND FACTS OF THE BRAZILIAN SOCCER CLUBS. THESE ENTITIES HAVE BECOME IMPORTANT SOURCES OF BUSINESS AND STAKEHOLDERS ARE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TRANSPARENCY OF THEIR TRANSACTIONS. RESULTS: THERE IS A LOW ADHESION OF SPORTS ENTITIES TO THE MANDATORY DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT OF THE 36 ITEMS OF MANDATORY DISCLOSURE, NO CLUB COMPLIED WITH 100\% OF THE RULES OF PUBLICATION, RECOGNITION, MEASUREMENT, AND DISCLOSURE ACCOUNTING. WHILE THE AVERAGE OF ALL CLUBS WAS 33.8\%, CLUBE DE REGATAS FLAMENGO AND SPORT CLUB INTERNACIONAL REPORTED 88.9\% OF THE MANDATORY DISCLOSURE. THEORETICAL/METHODOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTIONS: WE FIND THAT THE LEVEL OF MANDATORY DISCLOSURE IS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE INTANGIBLE ASSET, REVENUE, SPORTS PERFORMANCE, LOCALITY OF THE CLUB AND THE PERIOD OF EXPERIENCE IN DISCLOSING THE MANDATORY ACCOUNTING ITEMS. SOCIAL/MANAGEMENT CONTRIBUTIONS: THIS ANALYSIS CAN PROVIDE INSIGHTS THAT ALLOW THE STAKEHOLDER TO OBSERVE THE LEVEL OF ECONOMIC AND SPORTS ORGANIZATION OF BRAZILIAN SOCCER CLUBS, AND THE DEGREE OF COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY AND GOVERNANCE."

AUTHORS AIM TO VALIDATE NEW DATA PUBLISHED BY WALL STREET JOURNAL (WSJ) AND NCAA WEBSITES; AND TO DEVELOP A NEW CONCEPTUAL MODEL TO EXAMINE THE INTERACTION EFFECT OF TEAM POWERFULNESS AND TEAM REPUTATION ON GAME ATTENDANCE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS STUDY RELIES ON SECONDARY DATA COLLECTED FROM THE WSJ'S ``COLLEGE FOOTBALL'S GRID OF SHAME'' PUBLICATION AND THE NCAA OFFICIAL WEBSITE. DATA FOR 123 US COLLEGE FOOTBALL TEAMS ARE COLLECTED REPRESENTING 13 CONFERENCES FOR SEASONS 2010-2014. MULTI-LEVEL REGRESSIONS ARE UTILIZED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSES. FINDINGS RESULTS REVEAL THAT NOT ONLY TEAM'S POWERFULNESS IS REQUIRED FOR MORE PUBLIC ATTENDANCE TO GAMES, BUT ALSO TEAM REPUTATION STRENGTHENS THIS RELATIONSHIP. IN OTHER WORDS, TEAM REPUTATION PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN INCREASING GAMES' ATTENDANCE. TEAM REPUTATION ALONE DOES NOT BRING MORE ATTENDEES TO GAMES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS PAPER STUDIES THE RELEVANCE OF TEAM REPUTATION IN THE FIELD OF SPORTS MANAGEMENT. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE SUPERIOR FINANCIAL BENEFITS IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAMES, IT IS IMPORTANT TO PROPERLY MANAGE TEAM POWERFULNESS AND ITS LEGAL AND ETHICAL BEHAVIOR.

THE DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 73 BASKETBALL DUBS FROM FOUR SOUTH-EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. FINDINGS SHOW THAT PRIVATE SPONSORS ARE THE MOST INFLUENTIAL STAKEHOLDERS IN TOP QUALITY DUBS THAT PURSUE TOP SPORT AND FINANCIAL RESULTS MORE THAN LOCAL COMMUNITY INCLUSION AND OTHER NON-PROFIT OBJECTIVES. HIGHER-QUALITY LEVEL CLUBS PURSUE COST REDUCTIONS, TOP SPORT RESULTS, AND FAST RESULTS, WHILE DUBS WHERE VOLUNTEERS, LOCAL COMMUNITIES, THE STATE AND MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES HAD STRONGER IMPACT GIVE MORE EMPHASIS TO GROWTH, LOCAL COMMUNITY AIMS, AND LOWERING RISK."

TO INFORM THIS DECISION, WE REPORT ON OFFENSES OCCURRING AT A CAMPUS FOOTBALL STADIUM AND SURROUNDING COMMUNITY ON GAME DAY WEEKENDS BETWEEN 2009 AND 2013. CAMPUS POLICE LOG DATA FOR 35 HOME FOOTBALL WEEKENDS WERE EXAMINED, ACCOUNTING FOR 1,940 DISTINCT INCIDENTS. THERE WAS A GENERAL UPWARD TREND IN CRIME INCIDENTS. ON AVERAGE, 330 TOTAL CRIME INCIDENTS OCCURRED WHEN ALCOHOL WAS NOT SOLD (2009-2011) COMPARED TO 475 ANNUALLY WHEN ALCOHOL WAS SOLD (2012-2013). LIQUOR LAW VIOLATIONS AND ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION BY A MINOR WERE THE TWO MOST FREQUENTLY CITED OFFENSES. LIQUOR LAW VIOLATIONS (317) WAS HIGHEST AFTER ALCOHOL SALES INITIATED. POLICE INCIDENTS WERE MARKEDLY HIGHER WHEN PLAYING A TRADITIONAL FOOTBALL RIVAL AT HOME.

"CRETAN R, 2019, URBAN GEOGR";"RECENT SCHOLARSHIP IN CRITICAL TOPONYMY HAS RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE IMPACTS ON URBAN RESIDENTS OF SELLING NAMING RIGHTS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF CONTESTING THE COMMODIFICATION OF URBAN PLACE NAMES. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THESE ISSUES USING POLI TIMIOARA, THE MAJOR FOOTBALL TEAM OF TIMIOARA, ROMANIA, AS A CASE STUDY. THE CASH-STRAPPED LOCAL AUTHORITY SOLD THE NAMING RIGHTS FOR THE TEAM TO RAISE REVENUE. HOWEVER, WHEN THE CLUB'S PRIVATE OWNER WAS UNABLE TO FINANCE THE TEAM, THE LOCAL AUTHORITY REACQUIRED THE NAMING RIGHTS OF POLI, NOW UNDER THE NAME ASOCIAIA CLUB SPORTIV POLI (A NEW TEAM WITH A SMALL FAN BASE). DRAWING ON THE EVERYDAY NARRATIVES OF FANS, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW THE COMMODIFICATION OF A LOCAL CLUB NAME CAN CAUSE SOCIAL TENSIONS. THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING URBAN RESIDENTS' ACCESS, OR LACK THEREOF, TO SOCIAL CAPITAL RESOURCES AND HOW THIS LEADS TO THE MANIFESTATION OF SOCIAL INEQUALITIES WHICH CO-DETERMINE FANS' REACTIONS AND RESPONSES TO THE CHANGE IN THE NAME OF A SPORTS TEAM. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT COMMODIFYING NAMES CAN MOBILIZE SERIOUS CONTESTATIONS AMONG PARTISAN GROUPS ABOUT WHO OWNS THE NAME, ALTHOUGH SUCH CONTESTATIONS APPEAR TO BE ON UNCERTAIN GROUND BECAUSE OF POST-COMMUNIST URBAN PRACTICES OF DELAYED ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING."
"GIRMA Y, 2019, URBAN FOR URBAN GREEN";"GREEN SPACES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN IMPROVING THE LIVABILITY OF CITIES BUT ARE UNDER HIGH PRESSURE FROM DEVELOPMENT IN RAPIDLY URBANIZING COUNTRIES. UNDERSTANDING THE USE OF URBAN GREEN SPACES AND HOW THIS RELATES TO THEIR MANAGEMENT IS ESSENTIAL TO EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS AND HENCE INCREASE THEIR VALUE AND BETTER PROTECTION. RESEARCHES ON GREEN SPACE USE AND MANAGEMENT HAVE BEEN FREQUENTLY CONDUCTED IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW PEOPLE ACROSS CITIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA UTILIZE AND MANAGE URBAN GREEN SPACES. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY ATTEMPTS TO ANALYZE THE USE AND MANAGEMENT OF GREEN SPACES IN URBAN CENTERS OF ETHIOPIA WITH REFERENCE TO THE EMERGING TOWNS OF THE OROMIA SPECIAL ZONE SURROUNDING FINFINNE. THE STUDY EMPLOYED A HOUSEHOLD SURVEY, WHICH WAS UNDERPINNED BY INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSION. THE QUANTITATIVE DATA WAS ANALYZED THROUGH DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WHILE THE QUALITATIVE DATA IS ANALYZED THROUGH CONTENT AND CONTEXT ANALYSIS. RESULTS INDICATED THAT 71.9\%, 67.9\% AND 73.7\% OF RESPONDENTS IN LEGETAFO, SEBETA AND SULULTA DO NOT HAVE ANY GREEN SPACES IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD WHILE VERY FEW RESPONDENTS MENTIONED PLAYGROUNDS AND SPORT FIELDS AS GREEN SPACES. THE STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT RELAXATION AND PHYSICAL EXERCISES SUCH AS FOOTBALL PLAYING AND RUNNING ARE THE MAIN PURPOSES FOR VISITING GREEN SPACES. BASED ON THE RESULT OF THE STUDY MORE THAN HALF OF THE RESPONDENTS DO NOT VISIT URBAN GREEN SPACE. FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS, LACK OF SKILLED PERSONNEL, LOW COORDINATION BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS, LACK OF LEGAL FRAMEWORKS AND LIMITED AWARENESS OF THE COMMUNITY HAVE CONSTRAINED THE USE AND MANAGEMENT OF GREEN SPACES. THEREFORE, THE STUDY SUGGESTS IMPROVING THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK, ENHANCING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN GREEN SPACES DEVELOPMENT AND STRENGTHENING URBAN GREEN SPACE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AS IMPORTANT MEASURES TO IMPROVE THE USABILITY VIA GREEN SPACE MANAGEMENT IN URBAN AREAS OF ETHIOPIA."
"GEURKINK Y, 2019, INT J SPORT PHYSIOL PERFORM";"PURPOSE: TO PREDICT THE SESSION RATING OF PERCEIVED EXERTION (SRPE) IN SOCCER AND DETERMINE ITS MAIN PREDICTIVE INDICATORS. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 70 EXTERNAL-LOAD INDICATORS (ELIS), INTERNAL-LOAD INDICATORS, INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS, AND SUPPLEMENTARY VARIABLES WERE USED TO BUILD A PREDICTIVE MODEL. RESULTS: THE ANALYSIS USING GRADIENT-BOOSTING MACHINES SHOWED A MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR OF 0.67 (0.09) ARBITRARY UNITS (AU) AND A ROOT-MEAN-SQUARE ERROR OF 0.93 (0.16) AU. ELIS WERE FOUND TO BE THE STRONGEST PREDICTORS OF THE SRPE, ACCOUNTING FOR 61.5\% OF THE TOTAL NORMALIZED IMPORTANCE (NI), WITH TOTAL DISTANCE AS THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR. THE INCLUDED INTERNAL-LOAD INDICATORS AND INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS ACCOUNTED ONLY FOR 1.0\% AND 4.5\%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE TOTAL NI. PREDICTIVE ACCURACY IMPROVED WHEN INCLUDING SUPPLEMENTARY VARIABLES SUCH AS GROUP-BASED SRPE PREDICTIONS (10.5\% OF NI), INDIVIDUAL DEVIATION VARIABLES (5.8\% OF NI), AND INDIVIDUAL PLAYER MARKERS (17.0\% OF NI). CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE SRPE CAN BE PREDICTED QUITE ACCURATELY USING ONLY A RELATIVELY LIMITED NUMBER OF TRAINING OBSERVATIONS. ELIS ARE THE STRONGEST PREDICTORS OF THE SRPE. HOWEVER, IT IS USEFUL TO INCLUDE A BROAD RANGE OF VARIABLES OTHER THAN ELIS, BECAUSE THE ACCUMULATED IMPORTANCE OF THESE VARIABLES ACCOUNTS FOR A REASONABLE COMPONENT OF THE TOTAL NI. APPLICATIONS RESULTING FROM PREDICTIVE MODELING OF THE SRPE CAN HELP COACHING STAFF PLAN, MONITOR, AND EVALUATE BOTH THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL TRAINING LOAD."

THE METHODOLOGY USED IS THE SOCIAL RETURN ON INVESTMENT (SROI). SROI METHODOLOGY INCLUDES ALL THE BENEFICIARIES THAT ARE BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING AND ITS FISCAL AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE AIM IS TO ASSESS BOTH THE BENEFITS AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF A COMPANY'S ACTIVITIES ON STAKEHOLDERS. THIS TYPE OF ANALYSIS COMBINES THE USE OF QUALITATIVE, QUANTITATIVE AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION GATHERED AND ANALYZES THEM IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF `` VALUE'' INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, CREATED OR DESTROYED BY A BUSINESS ACTIVITY, BY A PROJECT OR BY THE OVERALL OPERATION OF AN ORGANIZATION. THE SPORT CLUB UNDER REVIEW IN THE PRESENT ANALYSIS IS CALLED VIRTUS ENTELLA, AN ITALIAN FOOTBALL CLUB PLAYING IN THE SECOND DIVISION. AN SROI INDICATOR WAS APPLIED IN REFERENCE TO THE BUSINESS ACTIVITY THAT TOOK PLACE DURING THE CHAMPIONSHIP SEASON 2017 / 2018. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SOCIAL IMPACT CREATED DURING THE CHAMPIONSHIP AMOUNTS TO APPROXIMATELY 44 MILLION EURO AGAINST A FINANCIAL INVESTMENT OF 15 MILLION EURO, PRODUCING AN SROI RATIO OF 2.98: 1.

"ROCKLOFF MJ, 2019, J BEHAV ADDICT";"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: INCENTIVES FOR WAGERING PRODUCTS CAN PROVIDE EXTRA VALUE TO GAMBLERS. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO FINANCIAL REASON WHY THIS ADDED VALUE SHOULD LEAD PEOPLE TO TAKE GREATER GAMBLING RISKS. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXPERIMENTALLY TEST IF WAGERING INCENTIVES CAUSE GAMBLERS TO CHOOSE HIGHER-RISK (LONG ODDS) BETS THAN UN-INCENTIVIZED BETS. METHODS: AN ONLINE EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED WITH WAGERING CUSTOMERS (N = 299, FEMALE = 12). PARTICIPANTS BET \$4 ON EACH OF SIX VIDEO GAME SIMULATIONS OF A SPORT THAT THEY HAD WAGERED ON IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (AUSTRALIAN FOOTBALL LEAGUE, CRICKET, OR SOCCER). EACH GAME OFFERED DIFFERENT COMMON WAGERING INCENTIVES: BONUS BET, BETTER ODDS/WINNINGS, REDUCED RISK, CASH REBATE, PLAYER'S CHOICE OF INDUCEMENT, OR NO-INDUCEMENT. FOR EACH GAME, PARTICIPANTS COULD BET ON LONG, MEDIUM, OR SHORT ODDS, AND SUBSEQUENTLY VIEWED A HIGHLIGHT REEL OF THE SIMULATED GAME OUTCOME AND BET OUTCOME. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS SELECTED SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER ODDS (I.E., RISKIER) BETS ON GAMES WHEN AN INCENTIVE WAS OFFERED COMPARED TO THE NO-INDUCEMENT CONDITION. BETTER ODDS/WINNINGS WAS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE INCENTIVE, FOLLOWED BY BONUS BET, CASH REBATE, REDUCED RISK, AND NO-INCENTIVE, RESPECTIVELY. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED BASED ON DEMOGRAPHICS OR PROBLEM GAMBLING SEVERITY. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: THE CHOICE OF LONG ODDS WITH INCENTIVIZED BETS INCREASES THE VOLATILITY OF PLAYER RETURNS. INCREASED VOLATILITY RESULTS IN MORE GAMBLERS IN A LOSING POSITION AND FEWER GAMBLERS WITH LARGER WINS. MOREOVER, IF LONG ODDS BETS ARE PRICED TO PROVIDE POORER VALUE TO BETTORS COMPARED TO SHORT ODDS, THEY WOULD INCREASE GAMBLERS' LOSSES AND EQUIVALENTLY INCREASE OPERATORS' PROFITS."

TOTALLY 89 TOKENS WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE OPEN SOURCE CODING PROCESS, THAT IN THE FIRST STAGE, CODING WAS CLASSIFIED INTO 11 CLASSES IN TERMS OF SUBJECT AND CONCEPT CLOSENESS. ALSO, RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE FACTORS AND CHALLENGES OF THE BRANDING IN IRANIAN BASKETBALL LEAGUE WERE THREE MAIN FACTORS, SUCH AS THE PHILOSOPHY AND NATURE OF BASKETBALL AND THE NATURE OF SPORT. CONCLUSION. BASED ON OUR RESULTS, IDENTIFICATION OF THE INTERNAL BRANDING FACTORS AND CHALLENGES OF THE IRANIAN BASKETBALL LEAGUE WAS RECOGNIZED AND THE PROPOSED MODEL WAS PRESENTED BASED ON IDENTIFIED CASES AT THREE LEVELS OF OPERATIONAL, INTERMEDIATE AND STRATEGIC."
"CHELMIS E, 2019, OPER RES";"FOOTBALL IN GREECE, AS WELL AS IN WHOLE WORLD, EXCEEDS THE LIMITS OF SIMPLY THE MOST COMMERCIAL AND WIDESPREAD SPORT, BECOMING ADDITIONALLY A MAJOR ISSUE IN THE POLITICAL AGENDA. THIS CAN EASILY BECOME UNDERSTOOD, OBSERVING THE IMPACT OF CRUCIAL FOOTBALL EVENTS (MUNDIAL, EURO CUP, CHAMPION'S LEAGUE ETC.) IN WORLD LEVEL. BESIDES THE ABOVE EVENTS, EACH FOOTBALL LEAGUE ATTRACTS THE INTEREST OF PEOPLE, MEDIA AND POLITICIANS. MANY STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE IN THIS FIELD, FOCUSING MOSTLY ON THE EFFICIENCY OF FOOTBALL CLUBS, ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS ENGLAND, SPAIN AND GERMANY. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE PERFORMANCE OF GREEK FOOTBALL CLUBS COMPETING IN THE SUPERLEAGUE FOR THE PERIOD 2012-2014, REGARDING THREE DIFFERENT ASPECTS (FINANCIAL, COMMERCIAL AND SPORT). OUR STUDY DIFFERENTIATES FROM SIMILAR STUDIES IN THE FOLLOWING POINTS: (A) THREE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS ARE EXAMINED IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A GLOBAL VIEW OF FOOTBALL CLUBS, (B) THE SAMPLE REGARDS GREEK SUPERLEAGUE TEAMS, A REGIONAL AND NOT SO WEALTHY CHAMPIONSHIP COMPARED TO OTHER EUROPEANS, AND (C) THE AIM IS TO RANK THE TEAMS, ACCORDANCE TO THESE ASPECTS AND NOT IDENTIFY THE EFFICIENT AND NOT EFFICIENT TEAMS. A WELL-KNOWN AND ESTABLISHED MULTIPLE-CRITERIA DECISION MAKING METHOD (PROMETHEE II) IS USED, WHICH HAS BEEN FOUND APPROPRIATE IN SEVERAL TOPICS REGARDING RANKING PROBLEMS. IN ORDER OUR RESULTS TO BE MEANINGFUL, A DECISION MAKER ASSISTED IN THE SELECTION OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL FACTORS IN FOOTBALL CLUBS EVALUATION. THE RESULTS PARTLY VERIFY EARLIER STUDIES, SINCE FOOTBALL CLUBS, WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS AND SURPRISES, WERE FOUND FINANCIALLY IMBALANCED, WITH STRONG PROFITABILITY, SOLVENCY AND LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS. THE DEPENDENCE OF GREEK SUPERLEAGUE ON TELEVISION RIGHTS AND THE BASIC SPONSORSHIP OF OPAP (STATE BETTING COMPANY) IS HIGHLY CONSPICUOUS AMID THE WIDER AND MUCH DISCUSSED EUROPEAN ECONOMIC CRISIS IN THE FIELD OF FOOTBALL.

"ROYUELA V, 2019, J SPORT ECON";"THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES WHETHER HAVING MORE FOREIGN PLAYERS INFLUENCES THE PERFORMANCE OF FOOTBALL CLUBS. WE DO SO BY COMPARING A CROSS SECTION OF CLOSE TO 1,000 FOOTBALL CLUBS ALL OVER THE WORLD. WE FIND THAT, ON AVERAGE, THOSE CLUBS IN LEAGUES WITH MORE FOREIGN PLAYERS DISPLAY BETTER RESULTS IN THE WORLD RANKINGS. NEVERTHELESS, WITHIN EACH LEAGUE, WHERE ALL CLUBS HAVE THE SAME REGULATIONS, HAVING MORE FOREIGN PLAYERS HAS NO EFFECT. IN THE END, WHEN ALL CLUBS HAVE THE SAME POSSIBILITIES FOR IMPORTING BETTER PLAYERS FROM ABROAD, WHAT MATTERS IS THE FINANCIAL POWER TO CHOOSE THE BETTER ONES."
"GHIO A, 2019, APPL ECON";"WE ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF STRICTER FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN SPORTING AND ECONOMIC RESULTS. WE APPLY A STOCHASTIC COBB-DOUGLAS PRODUCTION FRONTIER MODEL TO A SAMPLE OF ITALIAN SERIE A TEAMS, I.E. FIRST DIVISION, OVER THE PERIOD 2005-2015 TO EVALUATE THE VARIATION IN SOCCER CLUBS' COST EFFICIENCY FOLLOWING THE APPLICATION OF THE UEFA FINANCIAL FAIR PLAY (FFP) PRINCIPLES IN 2010. FFP IMPOSES STRICTER FINANCIAL REGULATION AS A REQUIREMENT FOR A CLUB TO BE ADMITTED TO UNION OF EUROPEAN FOOTBALL ASSOCIATIONS (UEFA) TOURNAMENTS. FIRSTLY, WE FIND THAT FFP DOES NOT IMPROVE THE AVERAGE EFFICIENCY OF THE ITALIAN FIRST DIVISION TEAMS. SECONDLY, WE SHOW THAT FFP HAS CONTRIBUTED TO LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD, REDUCING THE GAP IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY BETWEEN TOP TEAMS AND LOWER-TIER TEAMS."
"JONES C, 2019, J SPORTS SCI";"THE POPULAR METHOD OF ORGANISING YOUTH SPORT PARTICIPANTS INTO AGE DIVISIONS, BASED SOLELY ON THEIR BIRTHDATE, CAN RESULT IN AN IMBALANCE OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF PLAYERS. THIS IS KNOWN AS RELATIVE AGE EFFECT (RAE), WHICH INADVERTENTLY CREATES BIAS AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH DELETERIOUS SHORT AND LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES. THE OVERALL PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE HOW THE POTENTIAL FOR RAE IS MITIGATED WHEN SIMULTANEOUSLY ACCOUNTING FOR ADDITIONAL PLAYER CRITERION, SUPPLEMENTARY TO AGE. A MID-ATLANTIC AMERICAN YOUTH FOOTBALL REGISTRATION DATABASE WAS ACQUIRED, INCLUDING CHRONOLOGICAL (AGE), ANTHROPOMETRIC (WEIGHT), AND COMPETENCY (SKILL) FACTORS. PLAYER (N = 1,265) DATA WERE CLASSIFIED INTO QUARTILES AND MULTIPLE CHI-SQUARE GOODNESS OF FIT TESTS WERE CONDUCTED USING PROPORTIONS OF LIVE BIRTHS AS EXPECTED THEORETICAL DISTRIBUTION VALUES. WHEN DATA WERE CATEGORISED BY A SINGLE DEVELOPMENTAL CRITERION (E.G. AGE), RESULTS INDICATED SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURES (P <= 0.002) FROM EXPECTED PROPORTIONS. HOWEVER, WHEN CATEGORISED USING MULTIPLE CRITERIA (I.E. AGE, WEIGHT, AND SKILL), EQUITABLE BIRTHDATE DISTRIBUTIONS WERE OBSERVED. FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY INDICATE USING ONLY ONE DEVELOPMENTAL CRITERION FOR ORGANISING PLAYERS IS ASSOCIATED WITH RAE, WHEREAS APPROACHES ACCOUNTING FOR MULTIPLE VARIABLES ARE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH RAE. THIS STUDY PROVIDES YOUTH FOOTBALL PROGRAMS WITH EARLY EVIDENCE FOR CONSIDERING ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF ORGANISING PLAYERS."
"PLUMLEY D, 2019, SPORT BUS MANAG";"PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE COMPETITIVE BALANCE IN EUROPEAN FOOTBALL LEAGUES BEFORE AND AFTER THE INCEPTION OF FINANCIAL FAIR PLAY (FFP) REGULATIONS BY UNION OF EUROPEAN FOOTBALL ASSOCIATIONS IN 2011, DESIGNED TO BRING ABOUT FINANCIAL STABILITY AND IMPROVE COMPETITIVE BALANCE IN THE EUROPEAN GAME. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE TOP DIVISION FOOTBALL LEAGUES IN ENGLAND (ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE), GERMANY (BUNDESLIGA), FRANCE (LIGUE 1), ITALY (SERIE A) AND SPAIN (LA LIGA). THE PAPER IS ORGANISED INTO TWO DISTINCT TIME PERIODS: PRE-FFP, COMPRISING THE SIX SEASONS BETWEEN 2005/2006 AND 2010/2011; AND POST-FFP, COMPRISING THE SIX SEASONS BETWEEN 2011/2012 AND 2016/2017. THE PAPER USES RECOGNISED MEASURES OF CONCENTRATION AND DOMINANCE TO MEASURE COMPETITIVE BALANCE. FINDINGS THE RESULTS SHOW A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN COMPETITIVE BALANCE POST-FFP FOR LEAGUES IN SPAIN, GERMANY AND FRANCE BUT NOT FOR ENGLAND AND ITALY. FURTHERMORE, THE RESULTS REPORT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LEVELS OF CONCENTRATION AND DOMINANCE BY A SELECT NUMBER OF CLUBS IN GERMANY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE PAPER IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO ANALYSE COMPETITIVE BALANCE IN THIS WAY BOTH PRE- AND POST-FFP. WHILST THE PAPER CANNOT DEMONSTRATE A CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN FFP AND COMPETITIVE BALANCE, THERE ARE STRONG INDICATIONS THAT COMPETITIVE BALANCE HAS BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED (FOR SOME LEAGUES) SINCE THE REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN IMPOSED. TO THAT END, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT FFP HAS HAD ``UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES'' IN RESPECT OF COMPETITIVE BALANCE."
"PRIGGE S, 2019, SPORT BUS MANAG";"PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE WHETHER STOCKS IN FOOTBALL CLUBS ARE VALUED IN LINE WITH THE VALUATION OF OTHER CAPITAL ASSETS IN THE CAPITAL MARKET. MOREOVER, IT ANALYZES THE RISK PROFILE OF FOOTBALL STOCKS. BY TAKING THIS PERSPECTIVE, THE PAPER ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE DISCUSSION ON THE MOTIVES OF THOSE WHO INVEST IN FOOTBALL CLUBS, PARTICULARLY THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THEY EXPECT EXTRA BENEFITS, I.E., IN ADDITION TO DIVIDENDS AND SHARE PRICE APPRECIATION, FROM THE INVESTMENTS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE EMPIRICAL STUDY ANALYZES THE SHARE PRICES OF 19 LISTED EUROPEAN FOOTBALL CLUBS FROM JANUARY 2010 TO DECEMBER 2016. BUILDING ON THE CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL, THE AUTHORS USEDZELLNER'S (1962) SEEMINGLY UNRELATED REGRESSIONS. FINDINGS THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE FOOTBALL CLUBS IN THE SAMPLE ARE OVERVALUED. THIS IMPLIES THAT INVESTMENTS IN FOOTBALL STOCKS ARE MAINLY ATTRACTIVE FOR THOSE INVESTORS WHO EXPECT TO DERIVE EXTRA BENEFITS FROM THEIR INVESTMENT. THAT MIGHT BE LIKELY FOR STRATEGIC, PATRON AND FAN INVESTORS, BUT NOT FOR PURELY FINANCIAL INVESTORS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS AS A NEXT STEP, MORE ADVANCED FACTOR MODELS COULD BE APPLIED TO THE ANALYSIS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR INVESTORS, THE RESULTS IMPLY THAT PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION IS PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL WHILE BUYING FOOTBALL STOCKS. FOR FOOTBALL CLUBS, THE RATHER LOW GENERAL MARKET RISK, COMBINED WITH THE OVERVALUATION, LEADS TO LOW EQUITY COSTS WHEN NEW SHARES ARE ISSUED. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT DIVIDENDS AND SHARE PRICE APPRECIATION ARE NOT THE ONLY BENEFITS FOOTBALL STOCK OWNERS DERIVE FROM THE STOCKS, THUS UNDERLINING THAT FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS IN THEIR MOTIVES TO HOLD FOOTBALL STOCKS ARE VERY PROMISING."
"PROKOPIUK K, 2019, URBAN FOR URBAN GREEN";"IN COOLER REGIONS OF THE TEMPERATE CLIMATE, THERE IS A NEED TO EXTEND THE FOOTBALL GROUNDS ACCESSIBILITY BEYOND THE NATURAL GRASS VEGETATION SEASON DUE TO THE FOOTBALL SEASON SET BY UEFA FROM MID-FEBRUARY TO MID-DECEMBER. TURF COVERING IS ONE OF THE METHODS THAT CAN BE USED. AS THIS MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC STRESSES: REDUCTION OF COLD RESISTANCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF FUNGAL DISEASES, CHLOROPHYLL A FLUORESCENCE MEASUREMENTS WERE USED AS A METHOD FOR EARLY STRESS ASSESSMENT AND DETECTION OF GRASS REACTION TO COVERING. THREE VARIETIES FROM EACH OF THREE SPECIES: PERENNIAL RYEGRASS (LOLIUM PERENNE L.), KENTUCKY BLUEGRASS (POA PRATENSIS L.) AND RED FESCUE (FESTUCA RUBRA L.), WERE SOWN IN THREE REPLICATIONS FOR 3-YEAR LONG EXPERIMENT, DURING WHICH ASIDE FROM THE REGULAR TREATMENTS, PLOTS WERE COVERED WITH A WHITE POLYPROPYLENE CLOTH FOR 53 DAYS AT THE TURN OF WINTER AND SPRING AND FOR 37 DAYS IN AUTUMN. OBSERVATIONS PERFORMED EACH MONTH INCLUDED: VISUAL TURF QUALITY ASSESSMENT WITH PARALLEL MEASUREMENTS OF CHLOROPHYLL INDEX AND CHLOROPHYLL A FLUORESCENCE. CHLOROPHYLL INDEX GAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE GREENNESS OF THE TURF WHEREAS FLUORESCENCE TRANSIENT ENABLED COMPARISON OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATUS OF PLANTS AND EVALUATION OF WHETHER GRASS COVERING CAUSED A STRESS. IN GENERAL, COVERING IMPROVED TURF QUALITY, WHICH WAS NOTICEABLE NOT ONLY DURING THE COVERING BUT THROUGHOUT THE SEASON, AS ASSESSED VISUALLY AND BY DETECTORS, ESPECIALLY IN NOVEMBER. TURF COVERING EXTENDED GRASS VEGETATION WITHOUT LARGE FINANCIAL OUTLAYS, OPPOSITE TO THE CASE OF THE OPTIONAL TURF HEATING. BASED ON RESULTS OF CHLOROPHYLL A FLUORESCENCE MEASUREMENTS IT WAS SHOWN, THAT ADEQUATE PROTECTION OF THE TURF CAUSED NO STRESS, WHICH COULD REDUCE ITS QUALITY. THE POPULARIZATION OF SUCH A PROTECTION SYSTEM COULD AFFECT DECISIONS FOR THE CREATION OF A LOCAL ALL-SEASONS OUTDOOR SPORT FACILITIES AND THROUGH IT, INFLUENCE BOTH THE GREEN SPACE IN THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS DISSEMINATION OF SPORT AND PHYSICAL CULTURE."
"ABBOTT W, 2019, EUR J SPORT SCI";"THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE INFLUENCE OF INJURY, MATCH SELECTION AND TRAINING LOAD ON MENTAL WELLBEING (MW) IN A SQUAD OF PROFESSIONAL SOCCER PLAYERS. USING A LONGITUDINAL DESIGN, TWENTY-FIVE MALE SOCCER PLAYERS (AGE, 20 +/- 1 YEARS, HEIGHT, 1.80 +/- 5.79 M, BODY MASS 76.33 +/- 7.52 KG) FROM THE UNDER 23 SQUAD PLAYING IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE 2 DIVISION IN THE UK COMPLETED THE WARWICK-EDINBURGH MENTAL WELL-BEING SCALE (WEMWBS) EACH WEEK OF THE 2017/2018 SEASON (37 WEEKS IN TOTAL). INJURY AND NON-SELECTION FOR THE MATCH SQUAD WERE THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF MW (P < 0.05). INJURY HAD THE BIGGEST INFLUENCE ON MW THAT WAS LOWER WHEN INJURED VS. NOT INJURED (43.6 +/- 5.0 VS. 49.9 +/- 3.5, RESPECTIVELY, P = 0.001, ES = 1.48), ACCOUNTING FOR 40\% OF THE VARIATION IN MW. THIS INCREASED TO 50\% WHEN NOT BEING SELECTED TO PLAY GAMES WAS ALSO CONSIDERED. WEEKLY TRAINING LOADS MEASURED BY GPS (TOTAL DISTANCE, SPRINT DISTANCE AND TOTAL DURATION) AND INDIVIDUAL PLAYER WIN RATE DID NOT INFLUENCE MW (P > 0.05). THESE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF MONITORING MW IN PROFESSIONAL SOCCER PLAYERS AND SUGGEST THAT INJURED PLAYERS AND THOSE RARELY SELECTED FOR THE MATCH SQUAD SHOULD BE EDUCATED ON THE STRATEGIES AVAILABLE FOR MANAGING THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING."

WHILST RESEARCHERS HAVE DEVOTED INCREASING ATTENTION TO THE EFFECTS OF EMOTIONS, WE ARGUE THAT EXTANT RESEARCH IS PROBLEMATIC IN TWO WAYS. FIRST, EMOTIONS HAVE BEEN TREATED AS AN INTRAPSYCHOLOGICAL PHENOMENON RATHER THAN AN INTER- OR RELATIONAL PHENOMENON. SECOND, CURRENT WORK FOCUSSES ON HOW ACCOUNTING PRODUCES EMOTIONS, FAILING TO CONSIDER HOW EMOTIONS INFORM ACCOUNTING. TO ADDRESS THESE TWO SHORTCOMINGS, WE MOBILISE THE ECONOMIC ANTHROPOLOGY OF TARDE (1902), AND THE SUBSEQUENT WORK BY LATOUR AND LEPINAY (2009) AND LATOUR (2010; 2013), TO ARGUE THAT ALL INTERESTS ARE INHERENTLY `PASSIONATE INTERESTS'; THEY ARE MATTERS THAT `HOOK' ACTORS EMOTIONALLY. THIS THEORETICAL LENS IS USED TO NARRATE A FIELD STUDY CONSIDERING THE (CHANGING) PASSIONATE INTERESTS AND THEIR CONNECTIONS TO ACCOUNTING IN AN ELITE SWEDISH FOOTBALL CLUB. SPECIFICALLY, WE ANALYSE A NEXUS OF FOUR PASSIONATE INTERESTS THAT `HOOK' MANY (IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND WITH DIFFERENT DEGREES OF INTENSITY) - VIOLENT BEHAVIOUR, WINNING THE LEAGUE, PRESERVING THE CLUB FAMILY, AND DERBIES. MORE GENERALLY, THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT: FIRST, ORGANISATIONS ARE A NEXUS OF PASSIONATE INTERESTS; SECOND, SUCH INTERESTS RECURSIVELY INFORM THE DOING OF ACCOUNTING; THIRD, PASSIONATE INTERESTS ARE QUANTIFIABLE VIA A RANGE OF FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES, ENABLING THE CONSTRUCTION AND COORDINATION OF COLLECTIVES; AND, FOURTH, SOME PERFORMANCE MEASURES MATTER MORE THAN OTHERS WHEN (A) THEY ARE SIMPLE AND UNAMBIGUOUS, (B) GROUNDED IN ENDURING PASSIONATE INTERESTS WITH DEEP HISTORICAL ROOTS THAT TIE TOGETHER MEMBERS OF PROXIMATE COMMUNITIES, AND (C) TRAVEL BEYOND ORGANISATIONS AND PENETRATE DIVERSE ARENAS OF EVERYDAY LIFE, REPRODUCING THE EMOTIVE INTENSITY OF PASSIONATE INTERESTS.

"BENNETT KJM, 2019, SCI MED FOOTBALL";"TALENT IDENTIFICATION AND DEVELOPMENT IN FOOTBALL IS A COMPLEX, MULTIFACETED PROCESS. CURRENTLY, MOST OF THE RESEARCH IN THIS DOMAIN IS CONDUCTED IN HIGHLY RANKED, ESTABLISHED FOOTBALL NATIONS WHERE THE SPORT IS IMMENSELY POPULAR (E.G. GERMANY, PORTUGAL, BELGIUM, ETC.). WHILST THESE NATION'S DATA ARE INFORMATIVE TO SOME DEGREE, THERE IS LITTLE CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TRADITIONAL TALENT IDENTIFICATION APPROACHES. TYPICALLY, TALENT IDENTIFICATION INVOLVES ACTIVELY SELECTING PROMISING PLAYERS WITH EARLY PERFORMANCE SUPERIORITIES WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE CHANGES THAT CAN OCCUR DURING DEVELOPMENT. CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR EMERGING FOOTBALL NATIONS AS THE REPERCUSSIONS OF ADOPTING TRADITIONAL APPROACHES TO TALENT IDENTIFICATION ARE LIKELY GREATER DUE TO DIFFERENCES THE SIZE OF THE TALENT POOL, ACCESSIBILITY OF SYSTEMATIC TRAINING ENVIRONMENTS, AND AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL AND LOGISTICAL RESOURCES. IT IS PROPOSED THAT EMERGING FOOTBALL NATIONS SHOULD FOCUS ON: PREVENTING ACTIVE DESELECTION AND DROPOUT TO MAXIMISE THE SIZE OF THE TALENT POOL, MITIGATING THE INFLUENCE OF CONFOUNDING FACTORS ON TALENT IDENTIFICATION, AND LONGITUDINALLY TRACKING PLAYERS THROUGHOUT DEVELOPMENT TO DOCUMENT THE PERFORMANCE PROFILES THAT LEAD TO FOOTBALL EXPERTISE.

IT WAS PERCEIVED THAT MOST OF THE CLUBS SEGREGATE FROM PROFESSIONAL SPORTS ACTIVITIES (87.5\%) AND DISCRIMINATE BY THE NATURE OF REVENUE BETWEEN TICKETING SALES, SPONSORSHIP, TELEVISION, TRANSFER OF ATHLETES, AMONG OTHERS (80\%). IN ADDITION, CLUBS WITH HIGH DISCLOSURE LEVELS AND GOOD QUALITY INFORMATION HAD A BETTER SPORTING PERFORMANCE THAN THOSE WHO HAVE NOT. HOWEVER, CLUBS STILL DO NOT MEET THE OBLIGATION OF INTERPRETACAO TECNICA GERAL 2003 EVEN AFTER 4 YEARS SINCE IT HAS BEEN PUBLICIZED. MOREOVER, THERE IS A LACK OF COMPARABILITY BETWEEN THE STATEMENTS AND THE QUALITY OF THE INFORMATION DISCLOSED, ESSENTIAL ASPECTS FOR THE USERS. THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE RESEARCH FIELD THAT IT IS DISPERSED IN BRAZIL, AND FURTHERMORE, IT CAN IMPROVE THE MANAGEMENT IN SOCCER CLUBS SHOWING THE IMPORTANCE OF DISCLOSURE AND GOOD QUALITY INFORMATION."

"SCHUBERT M, 2019, SPORT ETHICS PHILOS";"UEFA'S FINANCIAL FAIR PLAY (FFP) REGULATIONS REPRESENT THE MOST RESTRICTIVE REGULATORY INTERVENTION EUROPEAN CLUB FOOTBALL HAS EVER SEEN. PUT SIMPLY, IT DEMANDS FROM CLUBS TO OPERATE ON THE BASIS OF THEIR OWN FOOTBALL-RELATED INCOMES. WHILE THE POLICY HAS ATTRACTED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION FROM THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SCIENCES, VERY FEW CONTRIBUTIONS SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATE IT FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL-ETHICAL PERSPECTIVE. THE PRESENT PAPER FILLS THIS RESEARCH GAP BY POSING QUESTIONS ON FFP IN RELATION TO FAIR PLAY AS A NORMATIVE CONCEPT. WE DRAW ON SPORT ECONOMIC ASSESSMENTS CONCERNING POTENTIAL OUTCOMES OF FFP AND ARGUE THAT THE POLICY SHOULD GO BEYOND THE MERE PRAGMATIC GOAL OF PROMOTING FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY AND TRULY AIM FOR CREATING A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD, OTHERWISE IT SHOULD NOT BE LABELED `FAIR PLAY'."
"VAN RIJN M, 2019, INT J SPORTS MARK SPONS";"PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE THE REASONS FOR THE DISCONTINUATION OF SPORTS SPONSOR-SPONSEE RELATIONSHIPS AND CATEGORIZE THEM. DESPITE THE NEGATIVE OUTCOMES OF A SPONSORSHIP DISSOLUTION, RESEARCH ON THIS TOPIC IS RATHER SCARCE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PAPER RELIES ON AN ANALYSIS OF 24 HISTORICAL CASES AND 19 IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS FOCUSING ON THE DUTCH SOCCER LEAGUE. SEVERAL SPONSORSHIP DISRUPTORS ARE IDENTIFIED AND CLUSTERED INTO FOUR CATEGORIES. FINDINGS - THE FOUR CATEGORIES FOR SPONSORSHIP DISSOLUTION ARE THE FOLLOWING: SPONSOR-RELATED FACTORS, SPONSEE-RELATED FACTORS, INTER-RELATIONAL FACTORS AND EXTERNAL FACTORS. IN TOTAL, TEN SPONSORSHIP DISRUPTORS ARE IDENTIFIED: INSUFFICIENT VALUE CREATION, OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED, SPORTS RESULTS, SIGNAL TO SOCIETY, EXCLUSIVITY, NEGATIVITY, PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP, CHANGED MARKETING STRATEGY, FINANCIAL SITUATION AND LEGISLATION AND REGULATION. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THIS STUDY PRIMARILY INVESTIGATES SOCCER SPONSORSHIP CASES. FUTURE RESEARCH COULD INVESTIGATE OTHER SPONSORSHIP AREAS, WHICH COULD YIELD DIFFERENT REASONS FOR SPONSORSHIP TERMINATION. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - PRACTITIONERS ARE ADVISED TO VIEW THE SPONSORSHIP RELATIONSHIP AS A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE, RATHER THAN A RESOURCE, FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE SPONSORSHIP. A SOLID RELATIONAL FRAMEWORK IS NEEDED, WHICH IS BUILT AROUND THE ELEMENTS OF TRUST, COMMITMENT AND COLLABORATIVE COMMUNICATION. IF SUCH A FOUNDATION DOES NOT EXIST OR HAS ERODED, THE SPONSORSHIP RELATIONSHIP IS FRAGILE AND CAN BE ENDANGERED BY VARIOUS FACTORS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS STUDY USES INDUCTIVE REASONING TO DEVISE A FRAMEWORK THAT ENABLES SPONSEES TO ANTICIPATE WHEN SPONSORS ARE LIKELY TO DISCONTINUE THEIR SPONSORSHIP SUCH THAT THE SPONSEES CAN TAKE ACTIONS ACCORDINGLY. APART FROM VALIDATING EXISTING REASONS FOR SPONSORSHIP DISSOLUTION, THIS RESEARCH ALSO PRESENTS NOVEL AND PREVIOUSLY UNDISCOVERED SPONSORSHIP DISRUPTORS."
"LIU D, 2019, INT J SPORTS MARK SPONS";"PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYZE FANS' PERCEPTIONS OF THE CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) ACTIVITIES OF A PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL CLUB, SPECIFICALLY WHETHER OR NOT PERCEIVED CSR PERFORMANCES ARE THEN LIKELY TO INFLUENCE PATRONAGE INTENTIONS OF THE FANS IN RELATION TO THE FOOTBALL CLUB. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PAPER USES THE EXAMPLE OF A PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL CLUB IN CHINA AS A CASE STUDY FOR DATA ANALYSIS. BASED ON A SAMPLE OF 451 HOME TEAM FANS, ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED THROUGH CALCULATION OF DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS, AND EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS. REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF PERCEIVED CSR PERFORMANCE ON FANS' PATRONAGE INTENTIONS. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT FACTOR 3 (CSR TO CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE) AND FACTOR 4 (COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH EDUCATION) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICTIVE OF ALL THE THREE PATRONAGE INTENTION VARIABLES, I.E. REPEAT PURCHASE, WORD-OF-MOUTH AND MERCHANDISE CONSUMPTION. IN ADDITION, FACTOR 2 (CHARITY) WOULD ALSO AFFECT MERCHANDISE CONSUMPTION INTENTION, BUT HAVE NO EFFECT ON ANY OTHER DIMENSIONS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - A SCALE MEASURING PERCEIVED CSR PERFORMANCE IN PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL CLUBS BY THE FANS IN THE CHINESE CONTEXT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. IN ADDITION, THE AUTHORS HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT THE TWO MAIN CSR FACTORS THAT WOULD INFLUENCE FANS' PATRONAGE INTENTIONS ARE: CSR TO THE CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND YOUTH EDUCATION. THUS, IF FOOTBALL CLUBS ARE TO USE CSR STRATEGICALLY TO LEVERAGE SPEND, THEN IT IS THESE TWO AREAS THAT THEY SHOULD FOCUS ON, EXPLICITLY IN RELATION TO CSR ACTIVITIES. THIS PAPER ADDS VALUE TO AN AREA THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDER-RESEARCHED IN RESPECT OF CSR ACTIVITIES IN CHINESE PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL."
"VINCENT LM, 2019, J STRENGTH COND RES";"THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE (NFL) HOSTS AN ANNUAL SCOUTING COMBINE TO EVALUATE THE APPROXIMATELY 300 ELITE COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYERS WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE SELECTED IN THE UPCOMING NFL DRAFT. GIVEN THE PUBLIC INTEREST, PLAYER OBLIGATIONS, COACHING STAFF COMMITMENTS, AND BUSINESS ASPECTS OF THE COMBINE, SEVERAL QUESTIONS HAVE AROSE IN RECENT YEARS CONCERNING THE APPLICABILITY OF COMBINE SCORES TO EVENTUAL DRAFT NFL PERFORMANCE. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPECIFIED NATIONAL SCOUTING COMBINE (NSC) SCORES AND MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE BY PLAYER POSITION. A SECONDARY AIM WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER CORRELATED VARIABLES COULD PREDICT PLAYER PERFORMANCE AT THE QUARTERBACK (QB), RUNNING BACK (RB), WIDE RECEIVER (WR), DEFENSIVE END (DE), DEFENSIVE TACKLE (DT), AND LINEBACKER (LB) POSITIONS. SUBJECTS IN THIS STUDY WERE COMBINE PARTICIPANTS BETWEEN THE YEARS 2005-2010 WHO SUBSEQUENTLY PLAYED IN THE NFL. THE POSITIONAL GROUPS INVESTIGATED WERE QBS (N = 44), RBS (N = 82), WRS (N = 116), LBS (N = 139), DES (N = 59), AND DTS (N = 72). COMBINE RAW SCORES FOR 40-YD DASH TIME, COUNTERMOVEMENT VERTICAL JUMP (CMVJ) HEIGHT, STANDING LONG JUMP (SLJ) DISTANCE, AND PROAGILITY TIME WERE RECORDED. MEASURES OF HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL POWER WERE CALCULATED FOR THE 40-YD DASH AND CMVJ. COMBINE SCORES AND ON-FIELD POSITIONAL STATISTICS FOR THE FIRST 4 YEARS FOR QBS AND 3 YEARS OF ALL OTHER PLAYERS' CAREERS WERE ANALYZED TO INVESTIGATE RELATIONSHIPS. SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS WERE SHOWN BETWEEN AT LEAST ONE COMBINE MEASURE AND ON-FIELD SUCCESS AT EVERY POSITION. HIERARCHAL REGRESSION SHOWED COMBINE MEASURES COULD PREDICT BETWEEN 4\% AND 62\% OF THE VARIANCE FOR INDIVIDUAL ON-FIELD VARIABLES. QUARTERBACK RUSHING YARDS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH 40T, CMVJ, VERTICAL JUMP POWER (VJP), VERTICAL JUMP RELATIVE POWER (VJRP), AND HORIZONTAL POWER (HP), AND THOSE FACTORS ACCOUNTED FOR 62.2\% OF THE TOTAL VARIANCE. HORIZONTAL POWER AND VJP WERE PREDICTIVE OF QB RUSHING ATTEMPTS (R(2)= 0.370). AT RB, 40T AND SLJ COMBINED WERE PREDICTIVE OF TOTAL RUSHING YARDS (R(2)= 0.200), RUSHING ATTEMPTS (R(2)= 0.195), AND YARDS PER GAME (R(2) = 0.197). POWER VARIABLES WERE PREDICTIVE OF TOTAL TACKLES FOR DES' 40HP (R(2)= 0.096) AND VJP (R(2)= 0.018), ACCOUNTING FOR A TOTAL OF 21\% OF THE VARIANCE. THE CURRENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT COMBINE TESTS ARE MODEST PREDICTORS OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE. SHOULD THE NFL CHANGE THE CURRENT NSC TESTING BATTERY, THE ADDITION OF HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL POWER MEASUREMENTS, AS WELL AS POSITION-SPECIFIC SKILL TESTS ARE RECOMMENDED."

WE EMPIRICALLY CONFIRM THE EXISTENCE OF CONFLICTING-MOOD DISTRACTIONS. WE FIND A STRONGER POST-EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENT DRIFT AND DELAYED RESPONSE RATIO AND WEAKER IMMEDIATE VOLUME REACTION WHEN THE NEWS (POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE) IN A FIRM'S EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENT IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE MOOD GENERATED BY THE WIN OR LOSS OF THE INVESTORS' LOCAL SPORTS TEAM IN A MAJOR GAME.

IN ORDER TO EXPLORE THE COMPONENTS OF THE MODEL, TWO ROUNDS OF FUZZY DELPHI STAGED BY A HALF-OPEN RESEARCHER-MADE QUESTIONNAIRE. THE RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS OF TWO FUZZY DELPHI ROUNDS INDICATED THAT, IN THE EXPERTS' VIEWS, THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF CLUB REPUTATION WERE PUBLIC RELATIONS (MEDIA AND SOCIAL RELATIONS), IDENTITY AND BRAND IMAGE OF THE CLUB, PERFORMANCE, TRADITION, SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, FAN ORIENTATION, QUALITY OF MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THE TEAM OR FOOTBALL CLUB. FURTHERMORE, THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE BASED ON TEAM REPUTATION IN TERMS OF EXPERTS INCLUDES THE COMPONENTS OF EFFICIENCY, RESPONSIVENESS, INNOVATION, QUALITY AND LOYALTY OF FANS. THE MODEL ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT THE CLUB REPUTATION WILL LEAD TO A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THROUGH THE FANS' SATISFACTION."
"ESCO MR, 2018, SPORTS";"THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BODY COMPOSITION AND PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES IN YOUTH SOCCER PLAYERS. TWENTY-FIVE COMPETITIVE MALE YOUTH SOCCER PLAYERS (AGE = 13.7 +/- 0.8 YEARS, HEIGHT = 167.4 +/- 9.7 CM, WEIGHT = 57.6 +/- 12.1 KG) VOLUNTEERED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS STUDY. HEIGHT AND WEIGHT WERE USED TO CALCULATE BODY MASS INDEX (BMI). BODY FAT PERCENTAGE (BF\%) AND FAT-FREE MASS (FFM) WERE DETERMINED WITH DUAL-ENERGY X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY. EACH ATHLETE PERFORMED THE PACER TEST, VERTICAL JUMP, AND T-TEST DRILL. PARTICIPANTS WERE PREDOMINANTLY NORMAL WEIGHT (20.4 +/- 2.7 KG.M(-2)). THE BODY COMPOSITION RESULTS WERE 20.3 +/- 4.9\% FOR BF\% AND 46.5 +/ - 8.7 KG FOR FFM. THE RESULTS OF THE PERFORMANCE TESTS INDICATED A MEAN STANDARD DEVIATION (SD) OF 1418 +/- 332 M FOR PACER, 57.2 +/- 7.4 CM FOR VERTICAL JUMP, 11.6 +/- 0.7 S FOR T-TEST. BODY MASS INDEX WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ANY PERFORMANCE MEASURE (R = 0.02 TO -0.21, ALL P > 0.05). BODY FAT PERCENTAGE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PACER, VERTICAL JUMP, AND T-TEST (R = -0.62, -0.57, 0.61, RESPECTIVELY; ALL P < 0.01) AND REMAINED AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR BMI. FAT-FREE MASS WAS ONLY SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO T-TEST (R = -0.43, P < 0.01). HOWEVER, AFTER CONTROLLING FOR BMI, FFM WAS RELATED TO ALL THREE PERFORMANCE TESTS. BODY FAT PERCENTAGE AND FFM ARE ASSOCIATED WITH PERFORMANCE IN YOUTH SOCCER PLAYERS, WITH STRONGER RELATIONSHIPS REPORTED IN THE FORMER METRIC. THE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR ACCURATE BODY COMPOSITION MEASUREMENTS AS PART OF AN ASSESSMENT BATTERY IN YOUNG ATHLETES."

MOREOVER, LIGUE 1 OPERATES WITH ONE OF THE BEST COMPETITIVE BALANCES IN THE BIG FIVE, WHICH IS DETRIMENTAL TO ITS CLUBS' SUCCESS AT THE EUROPEAN LEVEL. HOWEVER, THE LEAGUE AND A NUMBER OF CLUBS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CURB PAYROLL INFLATION AND HAVE NOT AVOIDED BEING RECURRENTLY RUN IN A DEFICIT AND ACCUMULATING DEBTS, IN PARTICULAR PAYMENT ARREARS AND PLAYER TRANSFER OVERDUE. LAX MANAGEMENT OCCURS, SINCE VERY FEW CLUBS HAVE BEEN SANCTIONED BY A PAYMENT FAILURE, EVEN FEWER BY LIQUIDATION, AND THERE HAS BEEN NO BANKRUPTCY. THE CONCEPT OF A SOFT BUDGET CONSTRAINT THEORETICALLY ENCAPSULATES SUCH EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE. THE NOVELTY OF THE PAPER IS TO ESTABLISH A LINK BETWEEN THE SOFT BUDGET CONSTRAINT AND THE PLAYERS' LABOUR MARKET WHERE IT CRUCIALLY TRIGGERS MARKET DISEQUILIBRIA: AN EXCESS OF DEMAND FOR SUPERSTARS' TALENTS AND AN EXCESS OF SUPPLY FOR JOURNEYMEN PLAYERS ARE MODELLED. DATA PAUCITY ABOUT PLAYER INDIVIDUAL WAGES HINDERS ECONOMETRIC TESTING OF THE AFOREMENTIONED LINK AND THE MODEL. HOWEVER, A LOOK AT TRANSFER FEES THAT CONCENTRATES ON A FEW OF THE TOP EUROPEAN SOCCER CLUBS PROVIDES A FIRST INSIGHT INTO THE ARMS RACE FOR TALENT THAT FUELS AN EXCESS OF DEMAND FOR SUPERSTARS AND DIPS A NUMBER OF CLUBS' FINANCE INTO THE RED."

"MAREQUE M, 2018, INT J FINANC STUD";"THIS PAPER ANALYZES WHETHER THE FINANCIAL FAIR PLAY (FFP) REGULATIONS SET BY UNION OF EUROPEAN FOOTBALL ASSOCIATIONS (UEFA) HAVE INFLUENCED THE AUDITING FEES CHARGED TO FOOTBALL CLUBS. IN ADDITION, IT EXPLORES THE DETERMINANTS OF AUDIT FEES. WE USED A TWO-SAMPLE T-TEST WITH EQUAL VARIANCES TO DETERMINE WHETHER DIFFERENCES ARE PRESENT. AFTER THIS, WE CARRIED OUT A PANEL DATA REGRESSION WITH THE CLUBS FIX EFFECT TO ESTIMATE THE DETERMINANTS OF AUDIT FEES IN FOOTBALL CLUBS. OUR FINDINGS REVEALED AN INCREASE OF AUDIT FEES AFTER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FFP REGULATIONS. ON TOP OF THAT, AUDIT FEES WERE EXPLAINED BY THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN INVESTORS IF THE AUDIT FIRM WAS ONE OF THE BIG 4 AND IF THE AUDITOR WAS A WOMAN. THE REGULATION CHANGE HAS HAD AN IMPACT ON THE AUDIT FEES CHARGED BY AUDITORS FOR THEIR SERVICES. HOWEVER, THIS INCREASE MAY BE COMPENSATED OVER FUTURE YEARS GIVEN THE IMPROVING FINANCIAL SITUATION OF CLUBS; THEREFORE, THE AUDITORS' RISK DIMINISHES AND SUBSEQUENT AUDIT FEES MAY BE REDUCED.

"TENFORDE AS, 2018, MED SCI SPORTS EXERC";"PURPOSE ATHLETES IN WEIGHT-BEARING SPORTS MAY BENEFIT FROM HIGHER BONE MINERAL DENSITY (BMD). HOWEVER, SOME ATHLETES ARE AT RISK FOR IMPAIRED BMD WITH FEMALE ATHLETE TRIAD (TRIAD). THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO UNDERSTAND THE INFLUENCE OF SPORTS PARTICIPATION AND TRIAD ON BMD. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT ATHLETES IN HIGH-IMPACT AND MULTIDIRECTIONAL LOADING SPORTS WILL HAVE HIGHEST BMD, WHEREAS NONIMPACT AND LOW-IMPACT SPORTS WILL HAVE LOWEST BMD. TRIAD RISK FACTORS ARE EXPECTED TO REDUCE BMD VALUES INDEPENDENT OF SPORTS PARTICIPATION. METHODS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY-NINE FEMALE ATHLETES PARTICIPATING IN 16 COLLEGIATE SPORTS COMPLETED DUAL-ENERGY X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY (DXA) SCANS TO MEASURE BMD Z-SCORES OF THE LUMBAR SPINE (LS) AND TOTAL BODY (TB). HEIGHT AND WEIGHT WERE MEASURED TO CALCULATE BODY MASS INDEX (BMI). TRIAD RISK ASSESSMENT VARIABLES WERE OBTAINED FROM PREPARTICIPATION EXAMINATION. MEAN BMD Z-SCORES WERE COMPARED BETWEEN SPORTS AND BY SPORT CATEGORY (HIGH-IMPACT, MULTIDIRECTIONAL, LOW-IMPACT, AND NONIMPACT). MULTIVARIABLE REGRESSION ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENCES OF BMD Z-SCORES ACCOUNTING FOR TRIAD AND BODY SIZE/COMPOSITION. RESULTS ATHLETE POPULATIONS WITH LOWEST AVERAGE BMD Z-SCORES INCLUDED SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING (LS, -0.34; TB, 0.21) SWIMMING/DIVING (LS, 0.34; TB, -0.06), CREW/ROWING (LS, 0.27; TB, 0.62), AND CROSS-COUNTRY (LS, 0.29; TB, 0.91). HIGHEST VALUES WERE IN GYMNASTICS (LS, 1.96; TB, 1.37), VOLLEYBALL (LS, 1.90; TB, 1.74), BASKETBALL (LS, 1.73; TB, 1.99), AND SOFTBALL (LS, 1.68; TB, 1.78). ALL TRIAD RISK FACTORS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER BMD Z-SCORES IN UNIVARIABLE ANALYSES; ONLY LOW BMI AND OLIGOMENORRHEA/AMENORRHEA WERE ASSOCIATED IN MULTIVARIABLE ANALYSES (ALL P < 0.05). ACCOUNTING FOR TRIAD RISK FACTORS AND BODY SIZE/COMPOSITION, HIGH-IMPACT SPORTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER LS AND TB BMD Z-SCORES AND NONIMPACT SPORTS WITH LOWER LS AND TB BMD Z-SCORES COMPARED TO LOW-IMPACT SPORT (ALL P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS BOTH SPORT TYPE AND TRIAD RISK FACTORS INFLUENCE BMD. ATHLETES IN LOW-IMPACT AND NONIMPACT SPORTS AND ATHLETES WITH LOW BMI AND OLIGOMENORRHEA/AMENORRHEA ARE AT HIGHEST RISK FOR REDUCED BMD."
"STRUEBING JE, 2018, NEW CRIM LAW REV";"THE RECENT INDICTMENT OF MORE THAN 40 INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES IN THE FIFA CORRUPTION SCANDAL DEMONSTRATES THE EXPANSIVE REACH OF THE FEDERAL CRIMINAL LAW, RAISING IMPORTANT QUESTIONS OF EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION AND SUBSTANTIVE LAW. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE EXISTING LAW IS SUFFICIENT TO CAPTURE PERVASIVE CORRUPTION IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS LIKE FEDERATION INTERNATIONALE DE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION (FIFA) WHEN THEIR TRANSACTIONS REACH DOMESTIC WIRES IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. THE PRINCIPAL CHARGE IN THE FIFA CASE, FOR EXAMPLE, FALLS UNDER THE RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS ACT (RICO). BUT THE EXTRATERRITORIAL APPLICATION OF RICO IS FAR FROM SETTLED LAW, AND THE DRAMATIC SCALE OF THE RACKETEERING CONSPIRACY WILL HAVE PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SUBSTANTIVE LAW, PRESENTING PROBLEMS OF LEGAL SPECIFICATION AND CHALLENGING THE TRANSACTIONAL MODEL OF CRIME. ONE OF THE INDICTMENT'S PREDICATE OFFENSES, MOREOVER, IS A NOVEL HONEST SERVICES FRAUD CHARGE THAT IMPLICATES THE VERY NATURE OF FIDUCIARY DUTIES IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETPLACE. THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT THE LAW SHOULD EXTEND FIDUCIARY PROTECTIONS AGAINST COMMERCIAL BRIBERY IN THE INTERNATIONAL SPHERE SO LONG AS THE VALUES UNDERLYING THOSE PROTECTIONS ACCORD WITH COLLECTIVELY SHARED NORMS. FINALLY, THIS ARTICLE ADVANCES A CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING, INFORMED BY THEORIES OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE AND DEVELOPMENT, OF WHY THE LAW SHOULD COUNTENANCE INTERNATIONAL CORRUPTION.

PLAYERS WERE CATEGORIZED BY THEIR POSITIONS: OFFENSIVE LINE-MEN (OLS), DEFENSIVE LINEMEN (DLS), TIGHT END, DEFENSIVE END, LINEBACKER, RUNNING BACK, QUARTERBACK, DEFENSIVE BACK, AND WIDE RECEIVER. THE HT, BM, AND BMI INCREASED AS GRADE INCREASED AMONG ALL POSITIONS. OFFENSIVE LINEMAN AND DL HAD THE GREATEST HT, BM, AND BMI (P <= 0.05). OBESITY PREVALENCE WAS GREATEST IN OL AND DL. WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR AGE-RELATED INCREASES IN BMI, BM INCREASED TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN HT. IF HT IS AN INDIRECT INDICATOR OF SKELETAL SIZE, ALTHOUGH BM IS MORE INFLUENCED BY SOFT TISSUE, THEN THE AGE-RELATED BMI INCREASES IN THIS STUDY MAY BE LARGELY ACCOUNTED FOR BY SOFT-TISSUE CHANGES RATHER THAN SKELETAL GROWTH. ALTHOUGH OBESITY PREVALENCE IN OL (94.5\%) AND DL (78.4\%) POSITIONS WAS GREATER THAN ALL OTHER POSITIONS AS DETERMINED FROM BMI, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW THE ALLOCATIONS OF FAT-FREE AND FAT MASS-PARTICULARLY IN AMERICAN FOOTBALL ATHLETES. IF OBESITY CONTINUES TO BE DEFINED AS AN UNHEALTHY ACCUMULATION OF FAT, THEN ATHLETES WHO MAY HAVE A GREATER RELATIVE PROPORTION OF LEAN SOFT TISSUE SHOULD NOT BE CLASSIFIED AS OBESE USING BMI (BM DIVIDED BY HT2). MORE SOPHISTICATED, RELIABLE, AND SENSITIVE MEASURE OF BODY COMPOSITION, SUCH AS SKINFOLDS, MAY BE MORE APPROPRIATE FIELD MEASUREMENTS."

WE ANALYZED VIDEO FOOTAGE OF SET SHOTS FROM ALL 198 MATCHES OF THE 2012 SEASON, COLLECTING DATA FOR KICK DISTANCE, KICK ANGLE, PLAYER POSITION, PLAYER EXPERIENCE (I.E., GENERAL AND SPECIFIC), KICK OUTCOME, AND WEATHER STATUS. WE FOUND AN AVERAGE OF 23.0 (STANDARD DEVIATION [SD]=4.5) SET SHOTS/MATCH, WITH A MEAN ACCURACY OF 55.0\% (SD=0.7\%). KICKING ACCURACY DECREASED WITH INCREMENTAL INCREASES IN KICK DISTANCE, WITH ACCURACY RANGING FROM 97\% (0-15M) TO 36\% (>= 50M). KEY FORWARDS WERE MORE ACCURATE KICKERS THAN OTHER PLAYERS. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF PLAYER EXPERIENCE. THE NUMBER OF SET SHOTS TAKEN DECREASED BY 13\% IN WET WEATHER CONDITIONS.

"BERKOWITZ JP, 2018, REV QUANT FINANC ACCOUNT";"USING A LARGE DATASET OF MATCHES PLAYED BETWEEN TWO PUBLICLY TRADED ENGLISH FOOTBALL (SOCCER) CLUBS, WE TEST FOR AND CONFIRM AN ASYMMETRIC MARKET REACTION TO WINNING AND LOSING AND THAT THE STOCK MARKET RESPOND STRONGER AND SLOWER TO BAD NEWS (LOSING) THAN GOOD NEWS (WINNING). IN CONTRAST TO PREVIOUS STUDIES, WE SHOW THAT FINANCIAL FUNDAMENTALS HELP EXPLAIN THIS ASYMMETRY. IN PARTICULAR, CLUB SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY LOSING BUT NOT IMPACTED BY WINNING. FURTHERMORE, LOSING IS A SIGNIFICANTLY STRONGER PREDICTOR OF FUTURE MATCH OUTCOMES THAN WINNING."

INCENTIVIZED BY ITS CARBON COST-EFFECTIVENESS, WASTE WATER HEAT EXCHANGERS (WWHX) HAVE BEEN SELECTED AND INCORPORATED IN A NEWLY CONSTRUCTED SPORTS PAVILION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BRIGHTON IN THE UK. THIS 2-M POUND SPORTS DEVELOPMENT SERVING SEVERAL FOOTBALL FIELDS WAS COMPLETED IN AUGUST 2015 PROVIDING EIGHT WATER- AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT SHOWER ROOMS FOR STUDENTS, STAFF, AND EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS. SIX OF THE SHOWER ROOMS ARE LOCATED ON THE GROUND FLOOR AND TWO ON THE FIRST FLOOR, EACH FITTED WITH FIVE OR SIX THERMOSTATICALLY CONTROLLED SHOWER UNITS. INLINE TYPE OF WWHX WERE INSTALLED, EACH CONSISTED OF A COPPER PIPE SECTION WOUND BY AN EXTERNAL COIL OF SMALLER COPPER PIPE THROUGH WHICH THE COLD WATER WOULD BE WARMED BEFORE ENTERING THE SHOWER MIXERS. USING THE INSTALLATION AT SPORT PAVILION AS THE CASE STUDY, THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO EVALUATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY OF A VERTICAL WASTE HEAT RECOVERY DEVICE, OVER A LIFE CYCLE OF 50 YEARS, WITH COMPARISON TO THE NORMAL USE OF A PVC-U PIPE. A HEAT TRANSFER MATHEMATICAL MODEL REPRESENTING THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE METHODOLOGY FOR MEASURING THE IN-SITU THERMAL PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL AND MULTIPLE USE OF SHOWERS IN EACH CHANGING ROOM. ADOPTING A SYSTEM THINKING MODELING TECHNIQUE, A QUASI-DYNAMIC SIMULATION COMPUTER MODEL WAS ESTABLISHED ENABLING THE PREDICTION OF ANNUAL ENERGY CONSUMPTIONS UNDER DIFFERENT SHOWER USAGE PROFILES. DATA BASED ON THE PROCESS MAP AND INVENTORY OF A FUNCTIONAL UNIT OF WWHX WERE APPLIED TO A PROPRIETARY ASSESSMENT SOFTWARE TO ESTABLISH THE RELEVANT OUTPUTS FOR THE LIFE-CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT. LIFE-CYCLE COST MODELS WERE DEVELOPED AND INDUSTRY PRICE BOOK DATA WERE APPLIED. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE SEASONAL THERMAL EFFECTIVENESS WAS OVER 50\% ENABLING SIGNIFICANT ENERGY SAVINGS THROUGH HEAT RECOVERY THAT LED TO SHORT CARBON PAYBACK TIME OF LESS THAN 2 YEARS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE ADDITIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WWHX. HOWEVER, THE LIFE-CYCLE COST OF THE WWHX IS MUCH HIGHER THAN USING THE PVC PIPE, EVEN WITH SIGNIFICANT HEAT RECOVERED UNDER HEAVY USAGE, HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED TO ADOPT MORE ECONOMIC CONFIGURATIONS, SUCH AS COMBINING WASTE WATER THROUGH FEWER UNITS, IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND IMPROVE THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY."

WE PROPOSE A TWO-STAGE METHOD THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO OTHER SETTINGS, ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE EXIST SAMPLE SIZE AND THEORETICAL/MODEL SPECIFICATION ISSUES: FIRST, MULTICRITERIA ANALYSIS IS USED TO RANK CLUBS ON THEIR FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS PERFORMANCE DIMENSIONS; SECOND, THESE RANKINGS AND THE LEAGUE STANDING (CAPTURING SPORTS PERFORMANCE) ARE USED TO ASSESS THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS OF THE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS BY MEANS OF A PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING APPROACH. WE FIND AN AMPHIDROMOUS POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND SPORTS PERFORMANCE, AND A ONE-WAY INVERSE RELATIONSHIP WHERE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AFFECTS SPORTS PERFORMANCE. PUT SIMPLY, MORE REVENUES AFFECT SPORTS ACHIEVEMENTS POSITIVELY AND THESE IN TURN IMPACT POSITIVELY ON REVENUES IN A VIRTUOUS CYCLE. THE HIGHER REVENUES DO NOT AID FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE GIVEN A RACE FOR SUCCESS THAT CAN BE POSSIBLY AUGMENTED BY STAKEHOLDER MYOPIA: THE INHERENT TO THE SPORT PURSUIT OF SHORT TERM OBJECTIVES TO THE DETRIMENT OF LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY. CONSEQUENTLY, THE ROLE OF REGULATORS (NATIONAL AUTHORITIES, UEFA FINANCIAL FAIR PLAY) AS CUSTODIANS, IS EVER MORE IMPORTANT IN PROTECTING CLUBS FROM FINANCIAL DISTRESS."

WHEREAS A NUMBER OF RESEARCHERS HAVE STUDIED INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL DETERMINANTS, KNOWLEDGE ON THE ROLE OF ORGANIZATIONAL-LEVEL FACTORS IS LIMITED. BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY, IN THE PRESENT STUDY, THE AUTHORS INVESTIGATE WHETHER AND HOW HUMAN RESOURCES, FINANCIAL, AND STRUCTURAL CAPACITIES OF SPORTS CLUBS INFLUENCE INDIVIDUAL VOLUNTARY ENGAGEMENT. USING DATA FROM GERMAN FOOTBALL AND TRACK AND FIELD CLUBS (N = 296) AND THEIR MEMBERS (N = 1222), THE EFFECTS OF ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY ON VOLUNTARY ENGAGEMENT WITHIN TWO SUBSAMPLES, ADULT MEMBERS AND PARENTS OF UNDERAGE MEMBERS, ARE EXAMINED. THE RESULTS OF MULTI-LEVEL MIXED EFFECTS REGRESSION ANALYSES SHOW THAT ALL CAPACITY DIMENSIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH VOLUNTARY ENGAGEMENT OF BOTH ADULT MEMBERS AND PARENTS OF UNDERAGE MEMBERS. A LARGER NUMBER OF MEMBERS AND A GREATER SHARE OF VOLUNTEERS REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME A VOLUNTEER DEVOTES TO VOLUNTARY WORK; ADULT MEMBERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO VOLUNTEER WHEN THEIR CLUB HAS A BALANCED BUDGET; AND STRATEGIC PLANNING INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF INDIVIDUALS TO VOLUNTEER INFORMALLY. OVERALL, THE RESULTS SUPPORT THE NOTION THAT THE ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT IS MORE RELEVANT TO VOLUNTEERING OF ADULT MEMBERS THAN INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS AND EQUALLY RELEVANT TO PARENTS OF UNDERAGE MEMBERS. MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS TO FACILITATE VOLUNTEERING, SUCH AS SHIFTING CLUB GOALS TOWARDS YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AND SPORTS FOR ALL PROVISION, ARE DISCUSSED.

"DIMITROPOULOS PE, 2018, INT J FINANC STUD";"THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE PREDICTABILITY AND PERSISTENCE OF EARNINGS OF THE EUROPEAN FOOTBALL CLUBS AND WHETHER THE NEW UNION OF EUROPEAN FOOTBALL ASSOCIATIONS (UEFA) FINANCIAL FAIR PLAY (FFP) LICENSING REGULATION HAS FORCED CLUBS TO PRODUCE A MORE PREDICTABLE EARNINGS STREAM. WE UTILIZED A SAMPLE OF 109 EUROPEAN TOP-TIER CLUBS OVER THE PERIOD 2008-2016, SUMMING UP TO 844 FIRM-YEAR OBSERVATIONS. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE INDICATED THAT THE CASH FLOW COMPONENT OF EARNINGS IS MORE RELEVANT IN PREDICTING ONE-YEAR AHEAD EARNINGS THAN ACCRUALS. THIS POSITIVE IMPACT OF CASH FLOWS FOR PREDICTING EARNINGS IS MORE SIGNIFICANT AFTER THE FFP REGULATION SINCE EARNINGS PREDICTABILITY HAS INCREASED DURING THAT PERIOD. MOREOVER, THE ABOVEMENTIONED FINDING IS MORE SIGNIFICANT FOR THE SMALLER LEAGUE CLUBS RATHER THAN THE BIG-5 LEAGUE CLUBS. THIS FINDING IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE FACT THAT SMALLER LEAGUE CLUBS ARE MORE IN NEED OF UEFA PRIZE MONEY RELATIVE TO BIG-5 LEAGUE CLUBS, THUS THEY ARE MORE INCENTIVIZED TO PRODUCE A MORE PREDICTABLE EARNINGS STREAM."

IN THIS SENSE IT IS NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY THE VARIABLES THAT REPRESENT THE SOCCER (FOOTBALL) VALUE CHAIN SYSTEMICALLY; TO UNDERSTAND THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THESE VARIABLES, THE MAIN DIFFICULTIES DERIVED FROM THIS INTERRELATIONSHIP AND TO POINT OUT VARIABLES THAT REQUIRE ACTIONS TO INCREMENT THE RESULTS OF THE SOCCER (FOOTBALL) VALUE CHAIN AS A WHOLE. HENCE, THIS STUDY APPLIED A SEMI-STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE WITH OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROBLEMS AND LEVERAGING VARIABLES THAT EXIST IN THIS SPORTS MODALITY. A CAUSAL LINKAGE DIAGRAM WAS ELABORATED BASED ON THE ANSWERS TO THE INTERVIEWS, SHOWING THE SYSTEMIC STRUCTURE OF THE SOCCER (FOOTBALL) VALUE CHAIN IN BRAZIL, WHOSE PREMISE IT IS TO IDENTIFY THE EXISTING CIRCULARITIES AND THE POSSIBLY EXISTING POINTS OF LEVERAGE. THE SYSTEMIC STRUCTURE POINTED TO THE ECONOMIC PARTICIPATION OF SOCCER (FOOTBALL) IN THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT AS A CENTRAL VARIABLE TO BE LEVERAGED, WHICH TENDS TO SYNTHETIZE THE RESULTS OF THE JOINT ACTION OF THE ACTORS IN THIS CHAIN. FURTHERMORE, THE VARIABLES THAT MAY LIMIT OR AMPLIFY THE GROWTH WERE IDENTIFIED.

"SCHNITZER M, 2018, SUSTAINABILITY";"EVEN THOUGH COOPETITION IN THE CONTEXT OF TOURISM IS NOT NEW, RESEARCH LACKS CONCRETE EXAMPLES WITHIN THE LEISURE BUSINESS AND ABOUT ITS EFFECTS ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES. HENCE, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES A SUPER-REGIONAL ALLIANCE OF TOURISM AND LEISURE SUPPLIERS AS WELL AS ITS EFFECTS ON THE COMMUNITY IN THE REGION OF TYROL, AUSTRIA. IN THE FRAMEWORK OF 60 GUIDED INTERVIEWS, ALL ORGANIZATIONS ENGAGED IN THE LEISURE CARD TIROL (LCT) WERE CONTACTED AND QUESTIONED. THE ANALYSIS OF THE QUALITATIVE DATA SHOWS THE MOTIVES FOR JOINING THE ALLIANCE ARE EITHER ECONOMIC OR NON-ECONOMIC IN NATURE, AND THUS THE ALLIANCE IS EVALUATED DIFFERENTLY BY THE VARIOUS SUPPLIERS. SEVERAL CORPORATIONS INCLUDING SWIMMING POOLS, ICE SKATING RINKS, MUSEUMS, A FOOTBALL STADIUM (LIMITED ACCESS), AND MOUNTAIN RAILWAY COMPANIES ATTRACT MORE LOCALS TO CONSUME LEISURE (A PARTLY MERIT GOOD) DUE TO THEIR MEMBERSHIP IN THE LCT ALLIANCE. HOWEVER, THE SUPPLIERS' HETEROGENEITY IN RESPECT OF THEIR MANAGEMENT (GOVERNMENTAL, PRIVATE, AND MIXED FORMS) IS SUGGESTED TO BE THE REASON BEHIND THE LCT'S FINANCIAL SURVIVAL. IN SUMMARY, INTENTIONAL COOPETITION IN THE CONTEXT OF A SUPER-REGIONAL YEAR-AROUND PASS MAY BE A SUSTAINABLE MODEL OF INCREASING A LOCAL COMMUNITY'S WELFARE BY PROVIDING AFFORDABLE LEISURE ACTIVITIES, ALTHOUGH SOME MINOR AND MAJOR ISSUES ON THE PART OF THE SUPPLIERS MIGHT OCCUR."
"IVASKOVIC I, 2018, EKON ISTRAZ";"THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE HOW PRIVATE FUNDING AFFECTS NON-PROFIT SPORT CLUBS IN TERMS OF THEIR STRATEGIC DECISIONS AND ORGANISATIONAL PERFORMANCE. DATA FOR THE STUDY WERE COLLECTED FROM A SURVEY OF 73 BASKETBALL CLUBS' MANAGERS FROM FOUR SOUTH-EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. EXPLORATIVE FACTOR ANALYSIS AND STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING WERE EMPLOYED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT STRONGER INFLUENCE OF PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, REFLECTED IN A HIGHER PROPORTION OF CLUBS' FUNDING FROM PUBLIC RESOURCES, AFFECTS CLUBS' STRATEGIES SO THAT CLUBS WITH A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF PUBLIC FUNDS: (1) EMPHASISE RISK REDUCTION MORE THAN FAST RESULTS; (2) EMPHASISE LOCAL COMMUNITY AIMS MORE THAN TOP SPORT RESULTS; AND (3) EMPHASISE ORGANISATIONAL GROWTH MORE THAN COST REDUCTION. THE STUDY EMPIRICALLY VERIFIED THE THESIS THAT CLUBS WITH A LARGER PROPORTION OF PUBLIC FUNDS ARE LESS SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF SPORT AND FINANCIAL RESULTS, WHICH IS PARTIALLY A CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR DIFFERENT STRATEGIC FOCUS. THE STUDY OFFERS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE STRUCTURE OF CLUBS' FUNDING AND ITS DIRECT (CLUBS' STRATEGIC CONDUCT) AND INDIRECT (CLUBS' PERFORMANCE) CONSEQUENCES."

DESIGN: A CASE STUDY OF A SEMI-PROFESSIONAL AUSTRALIAN RULES FOOTBALL CLUB COMPETING IN THE VFL (AN ELITE SECOND TIER AUSTRALIAN FOOTBALL COMPETITION). METHODS: DATA COLLECTED OVER A THREE-MONTH PERIOD COMPRISED INTERVIEWS, PARTICIPANT OBSERVATIONS, AND CASUAL CONVERSATIONS WITH PLAYERS AND STAFF. A NON-LINEAR PROCESS OF DESCRIPTION, ANALYSIS, AND INTERPRETATION FRAMED THE ANALYSIS, WHICH FOCUSSED ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN PERSONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES RELATED TO THE MANAGEMENT OF FOOTBALLERS' CAREER DEVELOPMENT. FINDINGS: TIME MANAGEMENT, THE DEMANDING NATURE OF NON-ATHLETIC OCCUPATIONS AND INCONSISTENT TRAINING SCHEDULES WERE THE MOST COMMON CHALLENGES FACED BY FOOTBALLERS WHEN COMBINING THEIR ATHLETIC CAREERS WITH THEIR NON-ATHLETIC EMPLOYMENT AND/OR EDUCATIONAL/VOCATIONAL PATHWAY. THE ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE FLEXIBLE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE FOOTBALL CLUB, AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR MENTORING BY SENIOR PLAYERS WERE IDENTIFIED AS FACILITATING FACTORS THAT NEEDED TO BE DEVELOPED. CONCLUSIONS: ANALYSIS OF THE FINDINGS SUGGESTS THAT IN ADDITION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONAL SKILLS SUCH AS TIME MANAGEMENT, DEVELOPING AN APPROACH TO DUAL CAREER DEVELOPMENT THAT IS: PLAYER DRIVEN; USES EXISTING SOURCES FOR MENTORSHIP AND SUPPORT AND; RECOGNISES THE SPECIFIC CHALLENGES FACING SEMI-PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLERS AND THEIR PORTFOLIOS OF WORK HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SUPPORT ATHLETES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR DUAL CAREERS.

"BACHMAIER B, 2018, SPORT BUS MANAG";"PURPOSE - IN ORDER TO SECURE A PROPER EXECUTION OF SPORTING COMPETITIONS, NATIONAL GOVERNING BODIES OF PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUES APPLY SPECIFIC REGULATORY PROCEDURES. IN THIS CONTEXT, SPECIAL FOCUS IS PLACED ON REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO ENSURE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF CLUBS. THEY, IN TURN, HELP AVOID NEGATIVE ECONOMIC EXTERNALITIES, I.E. THE PROBLEM THAT FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES FROM ONE CLUB CAN AFFECT OTHER CLUBS AND STAKEHOLDERS DUE TO THE INTERDEPENDENT RELATIONSHIPS OF THE COMPETITION. THESE REGULATIONS ON A NATIONAL LEVEL IN EUROPEAN PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUES SHOW SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO COMPREHENSIVELY ANALYZE FINANCIAL REGULATORY PROCEDURES OF PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUES TO GENERATE POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS OF THE REGULATIONS IN DETAIL. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - USING A DOCUMENT ANALYSIS OF THE REGULATION BOOKS OF THE ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE AND GERMAN BUNDESLIGA (BL), THIS STUDY COMPARES THE REGULATORY PROCEDURES OF THOSE IMPORTANT EUROPEAN PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUES. FURTHER EVALUATION WAS PERFORMED THROUGH A QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS TO DEVELOP A CATEGORY SYSTEM INCLUDING SIX CATEGORIES WITH 72 CRITERIA FROM DEDUCTIVE AND INDUCTIVE PROCEDURES. FOR MORE ADVANCED CODING, AN ASSESSMENT SCALE WAS INTEGRATED. FINDINGS - COMPARED TO THE PREMIER LEAGUE, THE REGULATION OF THE BL POINTS TO A MORE INTENSIVE REGULATION IN ALL CATEGORIES AND ACROSS ALL ANALYZED INDICES. THE RESULTS OF BOTH LEAGUES PARTIALLY REVEAL THAT ASSESSMENT AND MONITORING REQUIREMENTS TEND TO BE INEFFECTIVE, WHICH CAN SUBSTANTIALLY ENDANGER THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE WHOLE MONITORING PROCESS' AIMS. THE INTENTION TO ENSURE THE FINANCIAL STABILITY FOR SECURING THE LEAGUE COMPETITION CAN BE MISSED IN SUCH A SITUATION AND NEGATIVE ECONOMIC EXTERNALITIES CANNOT BE PREVENTED EFFECTIVELY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - FOR THE FIRST TIME, THIS STUDY INCLUDES ALL RELEVANT REQUIREMENTS OF FINANCIAL CLUB ASSESSMENT AND MONITORING. THEREBY, AN ABSTRACT COMPREHENSIVE AND SYSTEMATIC STRUCTURE FOR PROFESSIONAL TEAM SPORTS LEAGUES IS DESCRIBED AND ALLOWS FOR A CONCRETE INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON OF TWO EUROPEAN PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUES.

HOWEVER, THE ACTUAL COMPETITIVE BALANCE IN THIS LEAGUE HAS COME UNDER SCRUTINY IN RECENT YEARS AS THE TWO HISTORICALLY DOMINANT CAIRO CLUBS, AHLY AND ZAMALEK, CONTINUE TO RETAIN THE EPL CHAMPIONSHIP. A MAJOR CONCERN IS THAT THE COMPETITIVE IMBALANCE OF THE EPL MAY ACTUALLY BE HAMPERING THE LEAGUE'S PROGRESS AND THE PROGRESS OF SOCCER IN EGYPT. IN ORDER TO MORE CLOSELY ASSESS THIS SITUATION, THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO USE HISTORICAL EPL PERFORMANCE DATA TO CONDUCT A SERIES OF COMPETITIVE BALANCE ANALYSES ON LEAGUE RESULTS FROM 1948 TO 2014. THE FINDINGS REVEALED THAT COMPETITION IN THE LEAGUE IS ALMOST NONEXISTENT AS AHLY AND ZAMALEK CONTINUE TO ENJOY A NUMBER OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT FINANCIAL BENEFITS THAT ARE UNREALIZED BY THEIR COMPETITORS. THE DOMINANCE OF THESE CLUBS HAS COMPROMISED THE ELEMENTS OF MATCH UNCERTAINTY AND DRAMA THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY VIEWED AS BEING IMPORTANT TO THE PRESTIGE AND FINANCIAL ACHIEVEMENTS OF LEAGUES AND TEAMS. DISCUSSION IS THEREFORE OFFERED FOR HOW THE EPL COULD GO ABOUT RESOLVING SOME OF ITS ORGANIZATIONAL AND COMPETITIVE BALANCE ISSUES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS STUDY ADOPTED FOUR BASIC MEASURES OF COMPETITIVE BALANCE TO CONDUCT DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSES ON EPL DATA THAT WERE COLLECTED FROM EGYPTIANFOOTBALL.NET AND THE REC SPORT SOCCER STATISTICS FOUNDATION. THESE ANALYSES BEGAN WITH THE EPL'S INAUGURAL SEASON (1948-1949) AND EXTENDED TO THE CONCLUSION OF THE 2014-2015 SEASON. DURING THIS TIMEFRAME, SEVEN SEASONS WERE CANCELED DUE TO GLOBAL AND POLITICAL TENSIONS AND FOUR MORE WENT UNFINISHED. BECAUSE THESE SEASONS WERE EXCLUDED, THE TOTAL SAMPLE SIZE CONSISTED OF 56 SEASONS, EACH OF WHICH CONTAINED BETWEEN 10 AND 24 EPL TEAMS. THE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING VARIATIONS OF THE FOLLOWING COMPETITIVE BALANCE MEASURES: THE RANGE AND STANDARD DEVIATION OF WINNING PERCENTAGES, THE RATIO OF THE STANDARD DEVIATION/NOLL-SCULLY APPROACH, THE HERFINDAHL-HIRSCHMAN INDEX, AND FIVE-CLUB CONCENTRATION RATIO. FINDINGS THE RESULTS CONFIRMED THAT THE LEAGUE IS LARGELY IMBALANCED, LEADING THE AUTHORS TO RECOMMEND SYSTEMIC AND STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT COULD HELP PROMOTE COMPETITIVE BALANCE IN THE LEAGUE. THE CALL FOR COMPETITIVE BALANCE IN THE EPL WAS BOLSTERED BY A LITERATURE REVIEW OF STUDIES THAT ADVOCATED FOR PARITY IN PROFESSIONAL SPORTS LEAGUES. IN THE END, THE RESEARCHERS RECOMMEND THE EPL TO IMPROVE ITS ORGANIZATIONAL POLICIES AND CONSIDER A REVISED REVENUE-SHARING SYSTEM THAT WOULD ALLOW THE SMALL-MARKET TEAMS TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE EPL HOLDS A PROMINENT PLACE IN EGYPT'S SPORTING CULTURE AND SERVES AS THE STAGE FOR SOME OF AFRICA'S MOST COMPETITIVE SOCCER CLUBS. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO PERFORM A SERIES OF COMPETITIVE BALANCE ANALYSES ON EPL RESULTS FROM 1948 TO 2015 IN AN EFFORT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE VARIOUS DEGREES OF COMPETITIVENESS IN THE LEAGUE DURING THIS TIME."

SECONDLY, TO EVALUATE THIS EVIDENCE FROM A SPORTS ETHICS PERSPECTIVE, AND FINALLY, TO DISCUSS POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM. WE ARGUE THAT THE EVIDENT PERFORMANCE ADVANTAGE TEAMS GAIN THROUGH FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS IS CONTRARY TO THE SPIRIT OF SPORT AS IT UNDERMINES ATHLETIC EXCELLENCE AND THE `SWEET TENSION OF UNCERTAINTY OF OUTCOME' THAT IS CENTRAL TO GOOD COMPETITION. CONSEQUENTLY, FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS IN ELITE FOOTBALL OUGHT TO BE REGULATED AND CONTROLLED. WE ARGUE, HOWEVER, THAT CURRENT ATTEMPTS TO DO SO (VIA FINANCIAL FAIR PLAY REGULATIONS) ARE INADEQUATE AS THEY FOCUS ON ISSUES CONCERNING FINANCIAL HEALTH, RATHER THAN THE HEALTH OF THE GAME IN TERMS OF SPIRIT AND FAIRNESS."

FIRST, IT AIMS AT REFUTING THE VIEW THAT PROFESSIONAL SOCCER ONLY REQUIRES SOME BASIC EQUALITY OF CHANCES BEYOND THE DIFFERENCES IN PLAYERS' SKILLS AND MANAGERS' KNOWLEDGE OF GAME STRATEGY. IN OTHER WORDS, IT REFUTES THE VIEW THAT PROFESSIONAL SOCCER ONLY DEMANDS A NOTION OF FAIR COMPETITION UNDERSTOOD AS FAIR PLAY. SECOND, THE PAPER ALSO AIMS AT REFUTING THE VIEW THAT FAIR COMPETITION, IN PROFESSIONAL SOCCER, IS SIMPLY A MATTER OF FINANCIAL VIABILITY. HENCE, IT CALLS FOR BOTH GENUINE LEGAL AND ETHICAL REFORMS, SINCE PROFESSIONAL SOCCER COMPETITION REQUIRES A NOTION OF EQUALITY AS BOTH A GOAL AND A RIGHT. SUCH A NOTION, WE ARGUE, MUST CONCEIVE OF THE DIFFERENCES IN PLAYERS' SKILLS AND MANAGERS' KNOWLEDGE OF GAME STRATEGY AS ONE OF THE PRIMARY FACTORS IN ESTABLISHING A PLATFORM FOUNDED IN FAIR COMPETITION. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER CALLS FOR A RADICAL CHANGE OF ATTITUDE TOWARD OR A RADICAL APPROACH TO FAIR COMPETITION AMONG EUROPEAN SPORT FANS, POLICY-MAKERS, AND ADMINISTRATORS."

THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE NOT ONLY THE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF A FOOTBALL CLUB DURING THIS TIME, BUT ALSO THE INTERVENTIONIST ROLE OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITY DURING THIS TURBULENT PERIOD. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE AUTHORS INVESTIGATE THE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OF A SPORT BUSINESS, MIDDLESBROUGH FOOTBALL AND ATHLETIC COMPANY LIMITED, EXAMINING THE BROADER ECONOMIC CONTEXT, DRAWING ON UNSEEN ARCHIVAL SOURCES DATING FROM THE 1980S TO ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CLUB, LOCAL AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND THE REGIONAL ECONOMY. FINDINGS THEY NOT ONLY EXAMINE THE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF THE FOOTBALL CLUB BUT ALSO ANALYSE THE INTERVENTIONIST ROLE OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITY IN SUPPORTING THE CLUB WHICH HAD SYMBOLIC VALUE FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THIS PAPER IS RELEVANT TO POLICYMAKERS INTERESTED IN THE PROVISION OF LOCAL SPORTS FACILITIES AND THE LINKS BETWEEN ELITE SPORT AND PARTICIPATION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE AUTHORS SHOW THAT PROFESSIONAL SPORTS CLUBS ARE DRIVEN BY A DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL LOGIC TO STATE ORGANIZATIONS AND THE FINDINGS ENABLE THEM TO DEFINE THESE DIFFERENCES, THEREBY REFINING THORNTON ET AL.'S (2012) TYPOLOGY OF INSTITUTIONAL ORDERS. FURTHERMORE, THE CASE STUDY HIGHLIGHTS PRACTICES INVOLVING INFORMAL PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN STATE AND SPORT THAT THE AUTHORS LABEL AS SHADOW HYBRIDITY."
"ADAM I, 2018, ANN LEIS RES";"DESPITE THE CONTESTATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF LEISURE FREEDOM, PARTICULARLY AMONG MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS SUCH AS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, THERE HAVE BEEN LIMITED STUDIES TO ASCERTAIN THEIR LEISURE ASPIRATIONS. THE NEGATIVE SOCIO-CULTURAL CONNOTATIONS OF DISABILITY IN GHANA FURTHER CONSTRICTS DISABLED PEOPLES' LEISURE FREEDOM AND THEREFORE WARRANTS RESEARCH INTO THEIR LEISURE ASPIRATIONS. EMPLOYING DATA OBTAINED FROM 330 PEOPLE WITH VISUAL IMPAIRMENT, VIA A QUESTIONNAIRE, THE STUDY ESTABLISHED THAT THE RESPONDENTS EXERCISED LIMITED FREEDOM IN THE CHOICE OF THEIR LEISURE ACTIVITIES. ACTIVITIES DESIRED BUT OUT OF THEIR REACH INCLUDED JOGGING, PLAYING BOARD GAMES (LUDO, OWARE AND DRAFTS) PLAYING FOOTBALL, READING, VISITING RECREATIONAL AREAS, AND VISITING FRIENDS AND RELATIVES. REASONS FOR THEIR INABILITY TO INDULGE IN DESIRED ACTIVITIES ENCOMPASSED BODILY DYSFUNCTION, FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS, LACK OF SOCIAL SUPPORT AND INACCESSIBLE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT. THE PROBABILITY OF FACING ANY OF THESE CONSTRAINTS WAS BASED ON THE RESPONDENTS' AGE, MARITAL STATUS, FORMAL EDUCATIONAL STATUS AND MONTHLY INCOME."
"SCAFARTO V, 2018, CORP GOV -INT J BUS SOC";"PURPOSE THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HUMAN CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN THE PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL INDUSTRY. THE AUTHORS EXAMINE THIS ASSOCIATION BY CONTROLLING FOR INTERNAL (CLUB-LEVEL) MECHANISMS OF GOVERNANCE. SPECIFICALLY, AS THEY DEAL WITH A CONTEXT OF HIGHLY CONCENTRATED OWNERSHIP AND FAMILIAL CONTROL OF FOOTBALL CLUBS, THEY POSIT THAT THE DEGREE OF FAMILY BOARD REPRESENTATION AND A DUAL LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE EXERT A MODERATING EFFECT ON THE DECISION TO SPEND ON PLAYING TALENT. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS EMPLOYS A FIXED-EFFECT ECONOMETRIC MODEL ON A PANEL DATA SET OF 16 ITALIAN FOOTBALL CLUBS THAT SPANS A NINE-YEAR TIME PERIOD ENDING UP WITH 144 FIRM-YEAR OBSERVATIONS. FINDINGS THE MAIN NOVEL FINDING OF THIS INVESTIGATION IS THAT CLUBS WITH CEO DUALITY AND A HIGH DEGREE OF FAMILY BOARD REPRESENTATION MANAGE TO PROFIT FROM INVESTMENTS IN PLAYER CONTRACTS AS OPPOSED TO CLUBS WHICH LACK THESE GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS A CLEAR IMPLICATION IS THAT THE PRESENCE OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS AT CLUB LEVEL MAY BE VALUE-ENHANCING. IN TERMS OF POLICY DIRECTION, THE FINDING MAKES THE CASE THAT REGULATORY BODIES SHOULD CONSIDER THE IMPOSITION OF GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS AT CLUB LEVEL AS A MEANS TO PROMOTE ACTUAL FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE AND A FURTHER ALLY TO CURRENT REGULATIONS THAT ARE RESTRICTED TO MONITORING PROCESSES TIED TO ACCOUNTING DATA. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS STUDY ATTEMPTS TO EXPLAIN THE FINANCIAL OUTCOMES OF PLAYER INVESTMENTS BY COMBINING INSIGHTS FROM THE MAINSTREAM GOVERNANCE AND FAMILY BUSINESS LITERATURE.

YET DESPITE ITS GLOBAL AUDIENCE, FINANCIAL INFLUENCE, AND CULTURAL IMPORTANCE, THE SPORT'S GOVERNANCE HAS RECEIVED LITTLE ATTENTION IN POLITICAL SCIENCE OR INTERNATIONAL STUDIES. THIS ARTICLE SHOWCASES HOW FIFA REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT SITE FOR ANALYZING GLOBAL GOVERNANCE BY DEMONSTRATING HOW THE CONTEMPORARY SCANDAL IS PRIMARILY AN OUTCOME OF THE IDIOSYNCRATIC STRUCTURES OF THE ORGANIZATION ITSELF, WITH A PARTICULAR PATTERN OF INCENTIVES GENERATED FOR A SET OF ACTORS COMMONLY OVERLOOKED IN THE LITERATURE. IT EXPLAINS HOW SOCCER BUREAUCRATS FROM SMALLER COUNTRIES-SWITZERLAND, QATAR, AND TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO ARE DEPLOYED AS ILLUSTRATIONS-HAVE REGULARLY OUTMANEUVERED THEIR LARGER AND MORE CONVENTIONALLY POWERFUL COUNTERPARTS. SMALLNESS DOES NOT, THEREFORE, IMPLY A LACK OF POWER WITHIN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE: IT IS RATHER MEDIATED BY CONTEXT AND NOVEL FORMS OF AGENCY."
"MAKOFSKE MP, 2018, APPL ECON";"I ASSESS MONOPSONY IN THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL LABOUR MARKET AS IT RELATES TO BOTH TYPICAL AND ELITE PERFORMERS, WHILE ALSO ACCOUNTING FOR THE UNCERTAIN PERFORMANCE QUALITY OF PROSPECTIVE PLAYERS WHO ARE IN THIS LABOUR MARKET. EXISTING STUDIES SUGGEST THAT THE MARGINAL REVENUE PRODUCT (MRP) OF ELITE COLLEGIATE PLAYERS LATER DRAFTED INTO THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE (NFL), SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDS THEIR COMPENSATION. THESE COMPARISONS OVERSTATE MONOPSONY RENTS BECAUSE SCHOOLS DON'T KNOW EX ANTE WHICH PROSPECTS WILL BECOME THESE ELITE PERFORMERS. USING FINANCIAL DATA SPANNING 2004-2011 FROM 114 MAJOR SCHOOLS, I ESTIMATE THE MRP OF PLAYERS SORTED INTO THREE EX POST QUALITY TIERS, AND FIND THAT WHILE EVENTUAL NFL DRAFTEES GENERATE REVENUE THAT SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDS THEIR COMPENSATION, A MAJORITY OF SCHOLARSHIP PLAYERS DO NOT. THEN, USING RIVALS.COM TALENT RATINGS OF 6,604 PROSPECTIVE PLAYERS RECRUITED FROM 2002-2008, I ESTIMATE THE PROBABILITY THAT PROSPECTS WILL REACH EACH EX POST QUALITY TIER GIVEN THEIR EX ANTE RATINGS. MRP ESTIMATES ARE ADJUSTED BY THESE CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY ESTIMATES TO REFLECT THE EXPECTED MRP OF PROSPECTS, WHICH ALLOWS MORE APPROPRIATE ASSESSMENT OF MONOPSONY RENTS. I FIND THAT SCHOOLS POSSESS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS MONOPSONY POWER THAN UNADJUSTED MRP ESTIMATES SUGGEST."
"GASPARETTO T, 2018, SPORT BUS MANAG";"PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYSE THE DEMAND FOR TICKETS IN THE BRAZILIAN STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS FOCUSSING IN THE IMPACT GENERATED BY THE BRAND TEAMS AS WELL AS THE PLAY-OFF MATCHES IN THE DEMAND FOR TICKETS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, IN THE MATCH DAY REVENUES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - AN EQUATIONS SYSTEM BY THREE-STAGE LEAST SQUARE ESTIMATOR IS EMPLOYED. THE DATA SET COMPRISES 1,114 MATCHES FROM MINEIRO, CARIOCA AND PAULISTA CHAMPIONSHIPS OVER THE SEASONS 2013-2015. FINDINGS - ALL EXPLANATORY VARIABLES INCREASE BOTH ATTENDANCE AND MATCH DAY REVENUES. HOWEVER, THE MOST IMPORTANT GOAL IS THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH FOUND. THE PRESENCE OF BRAND TEAMS IN THOSE CHAMPIONSHIPS PROVIDES A FINANCIAL AID FOR SMALLER TEAMS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE PROPOSALS FROM THE MASS MEDIA TO EXCLUDE THE BRAND TEAMS AND DESIGN THOSE CHAMPIONSHIPS EXCLUSIVELY IN PLAY-OFF STAGES SHOULD NOT BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE POLICYMAKERS. ON THE CONTRARY, REARRANGING THE DESIGN OF THE COMPETITION WITH MORE MATCHES BETWEEN SMALL TEAMS AND BRAND TEAMS MAY HELP TO ALL OF THEM. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO INTRODUCE THE BRAZILIAN STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS IN THE SPORT ECONOMICS LITERATURE AS WELL AS EVIDENCES THE REDISTRIBUTION EFFECT OF WEALTH AMONG CLUBS."
"KRINGSTAD M, 2018, SPORT BUS MANAG";"PURPOSE - ATTENDANCE AT MATCHES IN THE SMALLER EUROPEAN FOOTBALL LEAGUES IS CHALLENGED BY THE INCREASED NUMBER OF LIVE BROADCAST MATCHES, PARTICULARLY COVERING THE BIGGEST LEAGUES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYSE THE EFFECTS OF LIVE BROADCASTING, MATCH SCHEDULING AND OTHER FACTORS ON STADIUM ATTENDANCE IN THE TOP DIVISION OF NORWEGIAN FOOTBALL. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON A FIXED EFFECTS REGRESSION MODEL ON ATTENDANCE AT MATCH LEVELS COVERING THE PERIOD 2005 TO 2011. FINDINGS - THE MAIN RESULTS SHOW TWO DIFFERENT EFFECTS. WHILE LIVE BROADCAST DOMESTIC MATCHES ON ``FREE TV'' IS POSITIVELY CORRELATED TO STADIUM ATTENDANCE, THE INCREASED NUMBER OF ``IMPORTED'' MATCHES FROM THE BIG-FIVE LEAGUES IS A SUBSTITUTE. MOREOVER, MATCHES PLAYED ON WEEKDAYS HAVE A LOWER LEVEL OF ATTENDANCE THAN WEEKEND MATCHES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE INCREASED NUMBER OF IMPORTED LIVE BROADCAST FOOTBALL MATCHES FROM THE BIGGEST EUROPEAN LEAGUES INFLUENCES AND WIDENS THE FINANCIAL GAP BETWEEN THE BIGGEST AND THE SMALLER FOOTBALL LEAGUES. ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION FOR REDUCING THE SUBSTITUTION EFFECT FROM THESE MATCHES IS A MORE EFFICIENT MATCH SCHEDULE IN THE NORWEGIAN TOP DIVISION IN FOOTBALL. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - NORWAY HAS A SMALL POPULATION WITH A HIGH INTEREST FOR FOOTBALL. THIS PAPER MEASURES EFFECTS ON ATTENDANCE IN THE NORWEGIAN TOP DIVISION IN FOOTBALL MATCHES WITH REGARDS TO THE INCREASED NUMBER OF LIVE BROADCAST MATCHES BOTH FROM THE DOMESTIC LEAGUE AND FROM THE BIG FIVE FOOTBALL LEAGUES."

ADDITIONALLY, UNIVERSITY ACADEMIC DONATIONS ARE STRONGLY RELATED TO BASKETBALL PERFORMANCE AND FIVE-STAR RECRUITS BRING IN AN ADDITIONAL US\$5,800,000 IN FUNDING ON AVERAGE AS A RESULT OF THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO TEAM SUCCESS. CALCULATIONS INDICATE THAT IF FIVE-STAR PLAYERS WERE TO BE FAIRLY COMPENSATED, THEIR EARNINGS WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY US\$613,000.

"KARAK A, 2017, REV RADICAL POLIT ECON";"THE DECADE OF THE 1980S WITNESSED MASSIVE CHANGES IN THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONING OF ENGLISH FOOTBALL.(1) SEVERAL RULES, INSTITUTED DURING THE INFANCY OF THE PROFESSIONAL GAME TO LIMIT PROFIT-MAKING, WERE OVERTURNED WITH REMARKABLE RAPIDITY WITHIN THE SPACE OF A FEW YEARS, CULMINATING IN THE FORMATION OF THE ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE (EPL) IN 1992. IN THIS PAPER, I ENGAGE WITH TWO QUESTIONS. ONE, WHY AND HOW WAS THE CENTURY-OLD STRUCTURE OF ENGLISH FOOTBALL SO RAPIDLY TRANSFORMED AND WHAT WERE THE CONSEQUENCES? TWO, WHAT SORT OF MARXIAN THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK CAN WE USE TO UNDERSTAND THE HISTORICAL TRAJECTORY OF ENGLISH FOOTBALL? WITH RESPECT TO THE FORMER, I FOLLOW DAVID HARVEY'S ANALYSIS OF NEOLIBERAL STRATEGIES USED TO RESTORE UPPER-CLASS DOMINANCE TO ARGUE THAT THE FORMATION OF THE EPL CAN BE INTERPRETED AS ANOTHER INSTANCE OF ACCUMULATION BY DISPOSSESSION, ONE AMONG MYRIAD ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE THE PROFITABILITY CRISIS OF THE 1970S BY CREATING AN AVENUE FOR FINANCIAL SPECULATION IN FOOTBALL CLUBS. TOGETHER WITH THE DEREGULATION OF TELEVISION, IT CONVERTED FOOTBALL FROM A DOMAIN FORMERLY REGARDED AS OFF-LIMITS TO THE CALCULUS OF PROFITABILITY INTO A BUSINESS PROPER. IN TERMS OF A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK, I PROPOSE THAT IT IS USEFUL TO THINK OF FOOTBALL AS SERVING GLOBAL CAPITALISM IN A DUAL MANNER: AS AN AVENUE FOR ACCUMULATION (THE ACCUMULATION FUNCTION) AND AS A TOOL FOR LEGITIMIZING CAPITALIST RULE BY PRODUCING ALIENATED CONSCIOUSNESS IN SOCIETY (THE LEGITIMATION FUNCTION)."

SUCH EXPLANATORY VARIABLES ARE RELATED TO LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND ON-FIELD AND OFF-FIELD PERFORMANCE. BASED UPON A SAMPLE OF NORTH AMERICAN MAJOR LEAGUE CLUBS AND THE MOST VALUABLE EUROPEAN SOCCER CLUBS AS EVALUATED BY FORBES OVER THE 2011-2013 PERIOD (423 OBSERVATIONS), OUR RESULTS INDICATE A RANGE OF VARIABLES WITH A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE NUMBER OF SOCIAL MEDIA FANS: POPULATION, NO COMPETING TEAM IN THE MARKET, CURRENT SPORTS PERFORMANCE, HISTORICAL SPORTS PERFORMANCE, FACILITY AGE, ATTENDANCE, OPERATING INCOME, EXPENSES/LEAGUE MEAN, AND BEING AN ENGLISH FOOTBALL CLUB. AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CLUBS' SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE IS IMPORTANT FOR CONTEMPORARY SPORT MANAGERS IN TERMS OF ENHANCING SUPPORTER COMMUNICATION, INVOLVEMENT, AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AS WELL AS MAXIMIZING CLUBS' REVENUE GENERATION POSSIBILITIES. OUR FINDINGS COULD HELP SPORT MANAGERS TO REALIZE THEIR CLUBS' SOCIAL MEDIA POTENTIAL IN PURSUIT OF THESE OBJECTIVES, SPECIFICALLY TO UNDERSTAND WHICH VARIABLES ARE UNDER-EXPLOITED AND WHY SOME CLUBS OVER-PERFORM, WHICH WILL ALLOW MANAGERS TO PRIORITIZE DECISIONS TO INCREASE THEIR NUMBER OF SOCIAL MEDIA FANS AND FINANCIAL VALUE."

IN THIS PAPER, AFTER THE PROBLEM IS DISCUSSED AND FORMALIZED, AN OPTIMIZATION MODEL WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF MAXIMIZING THE EXPECTED VALUE OF THE TEAM IS PRESENTED. THE MODEL ENSURES THAT THE TEAM HAS THE REQUIRED MIX OF SKILLS, THAT COMPETITION REGULATIONS ARE MET, AND THAT BUDGET LIMITS ARE RESPECTED. THE MODEL EXPLICITLY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE CAREER DEVELOPMENT OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS. A CASE STUDY BASED ON THE ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE IS PRESENTED. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE MODEL HAS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE CURRENT DECISIONS ENSURING A STEADY GROWTH OF THE VALUE OF THE TEAM. THE TEAM VALUE GROWTH REPORTED IS PARTICULARLY DRIVEN BY INVESTMENTS IN YOUNG PROSPECTS."
"ANGELINI G, 2017, J FORECAST";"WE PROPOSE AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO MODEL AND PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF FOOTBALL MATCHES BASED ON THE POISSON AUTOREGRESSION WITH EXOGENOUS COVARIATES (PARX) MODEL RECENTLY PROPOSED BY AGOSTO, CAVALIERE, KRISTENSEN, AND RAHBEK (JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL FINANCE, 2016, 38(B), 640-663). WE SHOW THAT THIS METHODOLOGY IS PARTICULARLY SUITED TO MODEL THE GOAL DISTRIBUTION OF A FOOTBALL TEAM AND PROVIDES A GOOD FORECAST PERFORMANCE THAT CAN BE EXPLOITED TO DEVELOP A PROFITABLE BETTING STRATEGY. THIS PAPER IMPROVES THE STRAND OF LITERATURE ON POISSON-BASED MODELS, BY PROPOSING A SPECIFICATION ABLE TO CAPTURE THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF GOAL DISTRIBUTION. THE BETTING STRATEGY IS BASED ON THE IDEA THAT THE ODDS PROPOSED BY THE MARKET DO NOT REFLECT THE TRUE PROBABILITY OF THE MATCH BECAUSE THEY MAY ALSO INCORPORATE THE BETTING VOLUMES OR STRATEGIC PRICE SETTINGS IN ORDER TO EXPLOIT BETTERS' BIASES. THE OUT-OF-SAMPLE PERFORMANCE OF THE PARX MODEL IS BETTER THAN THE REFERENCE APPROACH BY DIXON AND COLES (APPLIED STATISTICS, 1997, 46(2), 265-280). WE ALSO EVALUATE OUR APPROACH IN A SIMPLE BETTING STRATEGY, WHICH IS APPLIED TO ENGLISH FOOTBALL PREMIER LEAGUE DATA FOR THE 2013-2014, 2014-2015, AND 2015-2016 SEASONS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE RETURN FROM THE BETTING STRATEGY IS LARGER THAN 30\% IN MOST OF THE CASES CONSIDERED AND MAY EVEN EXCEED 100\% IF WE CONSIDER AN ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY BASED ON A PREDETERMINED THRESHOLD, WHICH MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO EXPLOIT THE INEFFICIENCY OF THE BETTING MARKET."

AN ESTIMATED 47.3 METRIC TONS (MT) OF WASTE WAS GENERATED, THE MAJORITY (29.6 MT WASTE) CAME FROM OFF-SITE, PRE-GAME FOOD PREPARATION ACTIVITIES; OF WHICH OVER 96 PERCENT (\%) WAS PRE-CONSUMER AND UN-SOLD FOOD WASTE. THE REMAINING 17.7 MT ORIGINATED FROM INSIDE THE STADIUM; RECYCLABLE MATERIALS ACCOUNTING FOR 43\%, FOLLOWED BY FOOD WASTE, 24\%. ELEVEN WASTE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES WERE EVALUATED USING THE WASTE REDUCTION MODEL (WARM). RESULTS INDICATE THAT SCENARIOS ACHIEVING ZERO WASTE COMPLIANCE ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS OR ENERGY USE. THE TWO MOST EFFECTIVE APPROACHES ARE ELIMINATING EDIBLE FOOD WASTE AND RECYCLING. SOURCE REDUCTION OF EDIBLE FOOD REDUCED GHGS BY 103.1 MT (CARBON DIOXIDE EQUIVALENTS) CO(2)E AND GENERATED ENERGY SAVINGS OF 448.5 GJ COMPARED TO THE BASELINE. PERFECT RECYCLING WOULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF 25.4 MT CO(2)E AND 243.7 GJ COMPARED TO THE BASELINE. THE PRIMARY CHALLENGES TO ACHIEVING THESE REDUCTIONS ARE THE DIFFICULTIES OF PREDICTING DEMAND FOR FOOD AND INFLUENCING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR."

"COSTA CAMARA JT, 2017, REV BRAS MED ESPORTE";"INTRODUCTION: IT IS KNOWN THAT INGESTION OF CARBOHYDRATE-CONTAINING BEVERAGES CAN ENHANCE SPORTS PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, MANY TEAMS DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO INVEST IN COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS AND NEED TO PREPARE THEIR OWN HYDRATION DRINKS. JACUBA IS A BEVERAGE USED AS SPORT DRINK (SOURCE OF CARBOHYDRATE) IN SOCCER CLUBS IN NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE INFLUENCE OF TWO BEVERAGES WITH CARBOHYDRATE ON BLOOD GLUCOSE, DEHYDRATION AND FATIGUE IN A SOCCER TEAM OF NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL. METHODS: TWENTY-TWO SOCCER PLAYERS WERE EVALUATED IN TWO DAYS OF PHYSICAL TRAINING, WITH INGESTION OF WATER AD LIBITUM AND TWO BEVERAGES: 1) MALTODEXTRIN-BASED DRINK, OR 2) JACUBA. CAPILLARY BLOOD GLUCOSE WAS MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER TRAINING. FATIGUE WAS ASSESSED USING BORG SCALE AFTER EXERCISE. TO EVALUATE THE DEHYDRATION OF THE ATHLETES AT THE END OF EXERCISE, THE URINALYSIS TEST AND THE VERIFICATION OF THE BODY MASS CHANGE DURING THE TRAINING WERE PERFORMED. RESULTS: BLOOD GLUCOSE CHANGED TO 13.1 +/- 29.5 MG/DL AND 7.6 +/- 22.2 MG/DL ON TRAINING DAYS WITH CONSUMPTION OF MALTODEXTRIN AND JACUBA, RESPECTIVELY, WITHOUT STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN BODY MASS AND IN WATER AND TOTAL FLUIDS INTAKE IN THE TWO DAYS OF TRAINING. THE BORG SCALE SCORE AFTER TRAINING WAS 15.2 +/- 2.6 AND 14.9 +/- 3.0 FOR MALTODEXTRIN AND JACUBA, RESPECTIVELY (P=0.12). CONCLUSION: JACUBA CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE HYDRATION AND MAINTAIN BLOOD GLUCOSE IN SOCCER PLAYERS BECAUSE THEIR RESULTS DO NOT DIFFER WITH THOSE OF MALTODEXTRIN-BASED DRINK."

THE PAM HAS BEEN APPLIED TO A LONGITUDINAL DATA SET OF ENGLISH FOOTBALL CLUBS (21 CLUBS BETWEEN 1992-2013) TO IDENTIFY TRENDS IN PERFORMANCE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT A SMALL NUMBER OF CLUBS HAVE CREATED AN IMBALANCE WITHIN ENGLISH FOOTBALL AND THAT THERE HAS BEEN EVIDENCE OF A ``FINANCIAL CRISIS'' AT INDIVIDUAL CLUBS. FOR THE MAJORITY OF CLUBS, OVERALL PERFORMANCE APPEARS TO VARY OVER TIME IN CYCLES. IN ADDITION TO MEASURING HOLISTIC PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL CLUBS IN ENGLAND, THE PAPER HAS DEVELOPED A STATISTICALLY ROBUST MODEL THAT PROGRESSES RESEARCH IN THE FIELD. THIS NEW MODEL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE ADAPTED TO FIT OTHER PROFESSIONAL TEAM SPORTS TO TEST LEAGUE VIABILITY.

EXAMINATION OF ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN USED TO DISCERN THE FUNCTIONS OF THESE CLOCKS IN HUMANS OUTSIDE OF CONTROLLED SETTINGS. HERE, WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF JET LAG, THAT IS, TRAVEL THAT SHIFTS THE ALIGNMENT OF 24-H ENVIRONMENTAL CYCLES RELATIVE TO THE ENDOGENOUS CIRCADIAN CLOCK, ON SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE METRICS IN MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL. ACCOUNTING FOR POTENTIAL DIFFERENCES IN HOME AND AWAY PERFORMANCE, TRAVEL DIRECTION, AND TEAM CONFOUNDING VARIABLES, WE OBSERVED THAT JET-LAG EFFECTS WERE LARGELY EVIDENT AFTER EASTWARD TRAVEL WITH VERY LIMITED EFFECTS AFTER WESTWARD TRAVEL, CONSISTENT WITH THE >24-H PERIOD LENGTH OF THE HUMAN CIRCADIAN CLOCK. SURPRISINGLY, WE FOUND THAT JET LAG IMPAIRED MAJOR PARAMETERS OF HOME-TEAM OFFENSIVE PERFORMANCE, FOR EXAMPLE, SLUGGING PERCENTAGE, BUT DID NOT SIMILARLY AFFECT AWAY-TEAM OFFENSIVE PERFORMANCE. ON THE OTHER HAND, JET LAG IMPACTED BOTH HOME AND AWAY DEFENSIVE PERFORMANCE. REMARKABLY, THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE EFFECTS FOR BOTH HOME AND AWAY TEAMS COULD BE EXPLAINED BY A SINGLE MEASURE, HOME RUNS ALLOWED. RATHER THAN UNIFORM EFFECTS, THESE RESULTS REVEAL SURPRISINGLY SPECIFIC EFFECTS OF CIRCADIAN MISALIGNMENT ON ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS."

WE FIND THAT SUCCESS IN MEN'S FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON A SCHOOL'S RESPECTIVE FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL REVENUES; HOWEVER, THE EFFECT IS DIFFERENT BASED ON THE TYPE OF SCHOOL. WE FIND THAT REGULAR SEASON WINS IN FOOTBALL ACCOUNT FOR MOST OF THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FOR ESTABLISHED SCHOOLS, WHEREAS INVITATIONS TO PRESTIGIOUS POSTSEASON BOWL GAMES PLAY A BIG PART FOR LESS-ESTABLISHED SCHOOLS. FURTHERMORE, WE FIND THAT STUDENT POPULATION AND EDUCATION QUALITY DISSIPATE THE EFFECT OF ATHLETIC SUCCESS ON MONETARY PAYOFFS. WE FIND THAT SUCCESS IN BASKETBALL CARRIES OVER MORE FROM THE PAST THAN IN FOOTBALL WITH ADDITIONAL CONTEMPORANEOUS MARGINAL EFFECTS FOR ESTABLISHED SCHOOLS. WE DO FIND, HOWEVER, THAT PAST ATHLETIC SUCCESS CARRIES OVER SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE PRESENT IN BOTH FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL, SUGGESTING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LONG-TERM MONETARY EFFECT OF ATHLETIC SUCCESS TO MANY ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES."
"KULCZYCKI W, 2017, SPORT BUS MANAG";"PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER CONSUMERS' ATTITUDE TOWARD SPORTING GOODS RETAILERS DEPENDS ON WHO ENGAGES IN CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) ACTIVITIES AND WHERE CSR TAKES PLACE. THE STUDY AIMS TO REPLICATE PREVIOUS FINDINGS ON FOOTBALL TEAMS (KULCZYCKI AND KOENIGSTORFER, 2016) FOR FOR-PROFIT SPORTING GOODS RETAILERS BY LOOKING AT HOW ORGANIZATION SIZE AND PROXIMITY OF THE SUPPORTED CAUSE TO THE RETAILERS' HEADQUARTERS INTERACT WITH CONSUMERS' MOTIVE ATTRIBUTIONS FOR CSR (PHILANTHROPIC VS PROFIT). DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - IN TOTAL, 200 PARTICIPANTS TOOK PART IN THE EXPERIMENTAL STUDY. THE STUDY APPLIED A BETWEEN-PARTICIPANT DESIGN MANIPULATING BOTH THE PROXIMITY OF THE SUPPORTED SOCIAL CAUSE (LOCAL VS DISTANT CSR) AND THE SIZE OF THE ORGANIZATION (SMALL-VS LARGE-SIZED ORGANIZATION) AND MEASURED PERCEIVED MOTIVES FOR CSR AS INDEPENDENT VARIABLES. ATTITUDE TOWARD RETAILERS WAS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS OF REGRESSION ANALYSES SHOWED THAT PERCEIVED PHILANTHROPIC MOTIVES INCREASED ATTITUDE TOWARD RETAILERS. THIS RELATIONSHIP BECAME STRONGER FOR LARGE-SIZED SPORTING GOODS RETAILERS, IN PARTICULAR WHEN THEY ENGAGED IN CSR ACTIVITIES AT DISTANT LOCATIONS. FOR SMALL-SIZED RETAILERS, THE PROXIMITY OF CSR DID NOT IMPACT ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MOTIVE ATTRIBUTION AND ATTITUDE TOWARD THE RETAILER. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - LARGE-SIZED RETAILERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO TAKE PARTICULAR CARE THAT CONSUMERS PERCEIVE CSR ACTIVITIES AS PHILANTHROPY-DRIVEN, ESPECIALLY WHEN SUPPORTING SOCIAL CAUSES AT DISTANT LOCATIONS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE STUDY REPLICATES PREVIOUS FINDINGS AND SHOWS THAT NOT ONLY FOR SPORTS TEAMS, BUT ALSO FOR SPORTING GOOD RETAILERS, CSR CAN INCREASE CONSUMER ATTITUDES EVEN WHEN THE CONSUMER POPULATION AT THE ORGANIZATION HEADQUARTERS' LOCATION DOES NOT DIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM CSR."

IT ILLUSTRATES HOW EVENT SEIZURE PLAYS OUT IN THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE FOOTBALL WORLD CUP 2018 IN RUSSIA, WHICH IS ON COURSE TO BECOME THE MOST EXPENSIVE WORLD CUP EVER WITH A TOTAL COST OF ABOUT USD 20 BILLION. DRAWING ON GOVERNMENT AND FIFA DOCUMENTS, PUBLIC STATEMENTS FROM AUTHORITIES AND OFFICIALS, AND MEDIA COVERAGE, THE PAPER EXAMINES THREE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF EVENT SEIZURE. FIRST, INFRASTRUCTURAL SEIZURE, WHERE EVENT-RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE, PARTICULARLY SPORTS VENUES, CROWD OUT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SERVES WIDER URBAN NEEDS. SECOND, FINANCIAL SEIZURE, WHERE A CLOSE CIRCLE OF POLITICAL AND BUSINESS ELITES BENEFITS FROM STATE FUNDING, WHILE THE PUBLIC UNDERWRITES COST OVERRUNS.

PRESSURE TO CHANGE THE MEMBERS' ASSOCIATION GOVERNANCE MODEL IN GERMANY INTENSIFIED DURING THE LATE 1990S AND AS A CONSEQUENCE, GOVERNANCE RULINGS WERE RELAXED TO ALLOW PRIVATE INVESTMENT INTO FOOTBALL CLUBS. UTILISING A CASE STUDY APPROACH, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A CASE STUDY INSIGHT INTO HAMBURGER SV FC, WHO UNLIKE THEIR COUNTERPARTS, VOTED TO REMAIN AS A MEMBERS' ASSOCIATION UNTIL 2014. THE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHTED THAT THE GOVERNANCE MODEL HELPED INSTIL DEMOCRATIC DECISION-MAKING AND INFLUENCED THE CLUB TO FAVOUR LONG-TERM PLANNING OVER A SHORT-TERMIST APPROACH. THE CLUB FACED MANY CHALLENGES TO THEIR CHOSEN GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE DUE TO THE GROWING PERCEPTION AMONG MEMBERS THAT IT WAS HINDERING THE CLUB'S ABILITY TO COMPETE ON THE FIELD. THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE GROWING BODY OF LITERATURE FOCUSING ON THE IMPLICATIONS A FOOTBALL CLUB'S OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE HAS ON PERFORMANCE."
"ZAROTIS I, 2017, REV PSICOL DEPORTE";"PARENTS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY INVOLVED IN THEIR CHILDREN'S SPORT EXPERIENCES. THEY TYPICALLY MAKE THE INITIAL DECISION TO ENROLL THEIR CHILDREN IN SPORT AND HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON MANY OF THE POSITIVE OUTCOMES OF THEIR CHILD'S SPORT PARTICIPATION. THE PRIMARY ROLE OF THE PARENT IN YOUTH SPORTS IS TO PROVIDE EMOTIONAL, FINANCIAL AND PROVISIONARY SUPPORT FOR THEIR CHILDREN. HOWEVER, THERE IS A GROWING CONCERN ABOUT THE PARENTS' EXCESSIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SPORTS AS IT SEEMS THAT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT ARE DETRIMENTAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPERIENCES OF YOUNG ATHLETE. THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE PERCEPTION OF ATHLETES AND PARENTS FOR THE PARENTAL ROLE IN FOOTBALL. THE SAMPLE WAS 128 PARTICIPANTS (ATHLETES AND THEIR PARENTS). THEY COMPLETE A QUESTIONNAIRE FOR THE PARENTAL ROLE IN SPORTS WITH THREE FACTORS: PARENTAL SUPPORT, PARENTAL PRESSURE AND ATHLETE'S SATISFACTION. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATED STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE DIFFERENCES AMONG ATHLETES AND PARENTS ON FACTORS OF PRESSURE AND SUPPORT. ATHLETES DEMONSTRATED LESS ``PRESSURED'' AND MORE ``SUPPORTED'' THAN THEIR PARENTS' PERCEPTION. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY FOR PARENT-CHILD PERCEPTIONS PRESENTS PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE NOTION THAT PARENTS AND THEIR CHILDREN DO NOT AGREE ON MEASURES OF PARENTAL PRESSURE AND SUPPORT IN THEIR CHILDREN'S SPORT."

DRIVEN BY SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURS EMBRACING `ROBIN HOOD' BUSINESS MODELS, THEY APPARENTLY DELIVER INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO SOCIAL PROBLEMS. SUCH FAIRYTALE NARRATIVES ARE INCREASINGLY POPULAR IN SCOTLAND WITH ITS REPUTATION AS A `HAPPENING PLACE' FOR SOCIAL POLICY INNOVATION.

ALSO, RECRUITING LOCAL YOUTH WORKERS, DEVELOPING AUTHENTIC PARTNERSHIPS, AND CREATING A NON-JUDGEMENTAL ENVIRONMENT DELIVERED A POSITIVE `RIPPLE EFFECT' BEYOND THAT POSSIBLE FROM CLASS-BLIND SPORT PROVISION. HOWEVER, `WIN WIN' RHETORIC IGNORES STRESSES FROM MEETING FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS AND MORAL DILEMMAS FROM TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN SOCIAL AND BUSINESS GOALS. THE ORGANISATION'S `NON-ESTABLISHMENT' NATURE IS PARTIALLY UNDERMINED BY EMPHASISING LOCAL POVERTY OF ASPIRATION AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL THINKING WITHIN DWECK'S `GROWTH MINDSET' AND DUCKWORTH'S `GRIT' RESEARCH.

THE GOAL OF THIS PAPER WAS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF A TEAM'S PROMOTION ON THE HOSTING ECONOMY BY USING LINEAR MODELS BASED ON REGIONALIZED SOCIAL ACCOUNTING MATRICES (SAMS). THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY IS APPLIED TO THE REAL CASE OF THE PROMOTION OF THE SPANISH TEAM CORDOBA F.C. OVER THE 2014-2015 SEASON.

BASED ON STAKEHOLDER SALIENCE THEORY, WE EXAMINE HOW INVESTORS EXERT THEIR SALIENCE AND WHICH OBJECTIVES THEY FOLLOW. SPECIFICALLY, WE DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN ECONOMIC AND SPORTING INVESTOR TYPES AND EXAMINE WHETHER ECONOMIC INVESTORS ACT AS A CG MECHANISM. RESEARCH METHODS: WE EMPLOY A DATABASE OF 160 PRIVATELY AND PUBLICLY OWNED FOOTBALL CLUBS IN EUROPE FOR THE PERIOD 2002-2015 TO MEASURE THE EFFECTS DRIVEN BY OWNERSHIP CONCENTRATION AFTER CONTROLLING FOR ENDOGENEITY BASED ON A DYNAMIC PANEL GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS. RESULTS AND FINDINGS: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT ECONOMIC INVESTORS FAVOUR SPORTING OVER ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE INVESTMENTS IN PLAYER TALENT ARE MADE UNDER HIGH RISK OF OUTCOME UNCERTAINTY AND ECONOMIC INVESTORS DO NOT, OR TO A LESSER EXTENT, MONITOR CLUB MANAGERS' ACTIONS AND DO NOT SERVE AS A CG MECHANISM. IMPLICATIONS: THIS IMPLIES A NEED FOR FOOTBALL CLUBS' INVESTORS TO REDEFINE THEIR ROLE TO ENSURE A FUNCTIONING GOVERNANCE SYSTEM. THE RESULTS FURTHER IMPLY THAT ARCHIVAL CG RESEARCH IN FOOTBALL CLUBS SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THE DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CG MECHANISMS AND A CLUB'S PERFORMANCE."

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE SAMPLE USED COMPRISES 94 TEAMS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE MAJOR EUROPEAN COMPETITIONS: GERMAN BUNDESLIGA, LIGUE 1 OF FRANCE, SPANISH LIGA, ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE AND THE ITALIAN SERIE A. THE ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE USED IS PANEL-CORRECTED STANDARD ERRORS. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS CONFIRM AN INVERTED U-SHAPED CURVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF BOTH MONITORING AND EXPROPRIATION EFFECTS. MOREOVER, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT AFTER FFP REGULATION, THE MONITORING EFFECT DISAPPEARS AND ONLY THE EXPROPRIATION EFFECT REMAINS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY SOME TEAMS HAS LIMITED THE SAMPLE SIZE. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES THAT THE VARIOUS REGULATING BODIES OF THE INDUSTRY SHOULD ADDRESS IS THE INTRODUCTION OF A CODE OF GOOD PRACTICE, NOT ONLY FOR ASPECTS RELATED TO THE TRANSPARENCY OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION BUT ALSO TO REQUIRE GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN THE INFORMATION CONCERNING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - REGULATING BODIES COULD ALSO CONSIDER OTHER ADDITIONAL CONTROL INSTRUMENTS BASED ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, SUCH AS FOR EXAMPLE, CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES, CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODES, GREATER TRANSPARENCY, CONTROL OF THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS, ETC. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS STUDY TRIES TO PROVIDE DIRECT EVIDENCE OF THE IMPACT OF LARGE MAJORITY INVESTORS IN THE CLUBS AND FFP REGULATION ON THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF FOOTBALL CLUBS."
"TERRIEN M, 2017, SPORT BUS MANAG";"PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TWOFOLD. FIRST, TO HIGHLIGHT THE HETEROGENEITY OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL AIMS WITHIN THE PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL TEAMS IN LIGUE 1. SECOND, TO UNDERSTAND WHY SOME TEAMS SWING FROM A WIN ORIENTATION TOWARDS A SOFT BUDGET CONSTRAINT FROM YEAR TO YEAR, AND VICE VERSA. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - FINANCIAL DATA FROM ANNUAL REPORTS FOR THE PERIOD 2005/2015 WAS COLLECTED FOR THE 35 LIGUE 1 CLUBS. TO DEFINE THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE INTENDED STRATEGY FOR THOSE CLUBS, AN EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED THANKS TO THE DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS METHOD. THIS MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE WAS SUPPLEMENTED WITH THE IDENTIFICATION OF PRODUCTIVITY AND DEMAND SHOCKS TO IDENTIFY WHETHER CLUBS SUFFERED FROM SUCH SHOCK OR CHANGED THEIR STRATEGY. IT ENABLES TO PRECISE THE NATURE OF THE EVOLUTION IN THE UTILITY FUNCTION, WITH REGARDS TO THE GAP BETWEEN EXPECTATION AND ACTUAL PERFORMANCE. FINDINGS - THE PAPER SUGGESTS THAT A TEAM CAN SWITCH FROM ONE ORIENTATION TO ANOTHER FROM YEAR TO YEAR DUE TO THE UNCERTAIN NATURE OF THE SPORTS INDUSTRY. THE CLUB DIRECTOR'S UTILITY FUNCTION COULD ALSO BE MAXIMIZED UNDER INTER TEMPORAL BUDGET FUNCTION IN ORDER TO ADJUST THE WEIGHT BETWEEN WIN AND PROFIT ACCORDING TO THE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE ENVIRONMENT. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE PAPER SHEDS NEW LIGHT ON THE WIN/PROFIT MAXIMIZATION. THE THEORETICAL MODEL PROVIDES AN ASSESSMENT OF THE WEIGHT BETWEEN WIN AND PROFIT IN LIGUE 1 AND THEN IDENTIFIES A NEW EXPLANATION FOR PERSISTENT LOSSES IN THE SPORTS INDUSTRY."
"FREESTONE CJ, 2017, SPORT BUS MANAG";"PURPOSE - THE INTRODUCTION OF FINANCIAL FAIR PLAY (FFP) REGULATIONS IN 2011 WAS ACCOMPANIED BY CRITICISM THAT THEY WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON COMPETITIVE BALANCE IN EUROPEAN FOOTBALL. COUNTER-POINTS WERE ALSO EXPRESSED, SUGGESTING THAT THE OPPOSITE WOULD OCCUR; THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY INCREASE COMPETITIVE BALANCE THROUGH REDUCING THE IMPORTANCE OF FINANCIAL POWER. THE LACK OF CLARITY AND COHESION ON THIS ISSUE PROMPTED THIS PAPER. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT FFP HAS HAD ON COMPETITIVE BALANCE IN THE ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE ANALYSIS CONDUCTED USES THE HERFINDAHL INDEX OF COMPETITIVE BALANCE AS THE PRIMARY METHOD, AND IS SUPPORTED BY STANDARD DEVIATION OF POINTS ANALYSIS AND A SCULLY-NOLL RATIO ANALYSIS, WHICH TOGETHER PROVIDE AN INDICATION OF THE LEVEL OF COMPETITIVE BALANCE FOR EACH OF THE PAST 21 SEASONS, FROM 1995/1996 TO 2015/2016. THIS EXAMINATION ALLOWS FOR THE TRENDS IN COMPETITIVE BALANCE TO BE IDENTIFIED, WITH EMPHASIS DRAWN ON THE SEASONS AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF THE REGULATIONS. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS PROVIDE NO INDICATION THAT FFP REGULATIONS HAVE RESULTED IN A DECLINE IN COMPETITIVE BALANCE IN THE EPL, INSTEAD HINTING THAT A POSITIVE EFFECT MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED. THIS POSITIVE EFFECT EXCEEDS THE PRIMARY AIM OF THE REGULATIONS AND UNDERLINES THEIR IMPORTANCE IN THE FUTURE STABILITY OF CLUB FOOTBALL. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - WHILE UNDERLINING THE NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE TOPIC, THIS STUDY PROVIDES THE FIRST INSIGHTS INTO THE EFFECTS OF FFP REGULATIONS ON COMPETITIVE BALANCE IN THE EPL. THESE INSIGHTS WOULD SUPPORT THE VIEW THAT FFP INITIATIVES HAVE BEGUN TO SHIFT THE FOCUS OF SPORTING COMPETITION AWAY FROM FINANCIAL STRENGTH TOWARDS MORE NATURAL MEANS OF COMPETITION SUCH AS EFFICIENCY, INNOVATION AND GOOD MANAGEMENT."

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - A DATA SET RELATING TO 20 EUROPEAN PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL CLUBS THAT COMBINES FINANCIAL (REVENUES AND COSTS), SPORTING, AND DIGITAL-REACH MEASURES FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE FOOTBALL SEASONS (2013/2014 TO 2015/2016) WAS USED. IN ADDITION, TO ELABORATE ON THIS DATA IN TERMS OF A DESCRIPTIVE STUDY, THE STUDY CONSTRUCTS A RANGE OF CORRELATION STATISTICAL TESTS AND LINEAR MODELING TECHNIQUES TO OBTAIN QUANTITATIVE RESULTS.

STAFF INVESTMENTS (STAFF COSTS) ARE ALSO POSITIVELY RELATED TO FACEBOOK FOLLOWERS, ALBEIT TO A LESSER EXTENT, WHILE HIGHER-RANKED CLUBS SEEM TO FOLLOW A CONSTANT APPROACH IN TERMS OF THEIR REVENUES AND COST STRUCTURE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS STUDY SEEKS TO BRIDGE THE COMMUNICATION AND SPORT ECONOMIC RESEARCH, PROVIDING EVIDENCE THAT FACEBOOK FOLLOWERS ARE PART OF THE CYCLICAL PHENOMENON OF TEAM REVENUES AND TEAM PERFORMANCE. IN DOING SO, IT INITIATES A DEBATE ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DIGITAL EXPANSION OF A FOOTBALL CLUB AND ITS SPORTS AND FINANCIAL INDICATORS."

AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THESE SHIFTING CONDITIONS WE INVESTIGATE TO WHAT EXTENT THE SUCCESS OF FOOTBALL TEAMS IN THEIR NATIONAL LEAGUES IS DETERMINED BY: (A) THE MONETARY VALUE OF THE TEAM EXPRESSED IN ITS MARKET VALUE, (B) THE INEQUALITY WITHIN THE TEAM, (C) THE CULTURAL DIVERSITY OF THE TEAM, AND (D) THE DEGREE OF FLUCTUATION AMONG THE TEAM MEMBERS. THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS REFERS TO FIVE FOOTBALL SEASONS, SPANNING FROM 2011/2012 UNTIL 2015/2016, AND INCLUDES THE TWELVE MOST IMPORTANT EUROPEAN FOOTBALL LEAGUES. THE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THAT SUCCESS IN NATIONAL FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS IS HIGHLY PREDICTABLE. THE MARKET VALUE OF A TEAM IS BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT SINGLE PREDICTOR, WHEREAS DIFFERENT FEATURES OF A TEAM'S COMPOSITION - INEQUALITY, CULTURAL DIVERSITY, AND FLUCTUATION - ARE LESS DECISIVE. HOWEVER, THE MARKET VALUE OF A TEAM DOES NOT PLAY THE SAME ROLE IN ALL OF THE LEAGUES. THE LOWER THE DEGREE OF FINANCIAL INEQUALITY IN A LEAGUE, THE LOWER THE IMPACT OF THE MARKET VALUE ON TEAMS' PERFORMANCE."

"LINTU N, 2016, J PHYS ACT HEALTH";"BACKGROUND: THERE ARE FEW STUDIES ON DETERMINANTS OF CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS (CRF) AMONG GIRLS AND BOYS SEPARATELY IN POPULATION SAMPLES OF CHILDREN. METHODS: WE THEREFORE INVESTIGATED THE DETERMINANTS OF CRF, ASSESSED BY MAXIMAL WORKLOAD PER HEIGHT USING ALLOMETRIC SCALING, IN A POPULATION SAMPLE OF 162 GIRLS AND 177 BOYS AGED 6 TO 8 YEARS. WE USED AUTOMATED BOOTSTRAP FEATURE SELECTION AND LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS. RESULTS: THE STRONGEST DETERMINANTS OF CRF AMONG GIRLS WERE MAXIMAL HEART RATE (HR; STANDARDIZED REGRESSION COEFFICIENT [BETA] = 0.31, P <.001), UNSUPERVISED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY = 0.29, P <.001), LEAN BODY MASS (BETA = 0.23, P =.001), AND ERRORS IN STATIC BALANCE TEST (BETA= -0.16, P =.02), ACCOUNTING ALTOGETHER FOR 25.7\% OF VARIATION IN CRF. IN BOYS, UNSUPERVISED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BETA = 0.24, P <.001), RESTING HR (BETA = 0.25, P <.001), HAND GRIP STRENGTH (BETA = 0.21, P =.001), ERRORS IN STATIC BALANCE TEST (BETA = -0.16, P =.01), ORGANIZED FOOTBALL (BETA = 0.16, P =.01), AND UNSUPERVISED TRAMPOLINE JUMPING (BETA = 0.14, P =.04) WERE THE STRONGEST DETERMINANTS OF CRF, ACCOUNTING ALTOGETHER FOR 29.7\% OF VARIATION IN CRF. CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT UNSUPERVISED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS SUFFICIENT IN IMPROVING CRF IN BOTH SEXES. FURTHERMORE, LARGER MUSCLE MASS AND BETTER BALANCE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER CRF THAT HAS TO,BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN ASSESSING CRF USING MAXIMAL CYCLE ERGOMETER EXERCISE TEST AMONG CHILDREN."

WE SHOW THAT WHILE THE SPORTS AND BUSINESS LOGICS AT TIMES COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER, IN OTHER SITUATIONS THEY ARE IN HARMONY. WE EXPLAIN THIS WITH REFERENCE TO AN AMBIGUOUS CAUSE-EFFECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE LOGICS WHICH ALLOWS FOR DIFFERENT WAYS OF ENACTING THE LOGICS. OUR STUDY THUS DEMONSTRATES THAT COMPATIBILITY OF LOGICS MAY VARY NOT JUST BETWEEN FIELDS AND ORGANIZATIONS, AS THE LITERATURE HAS EMPHASIZED, BUT ALSO BETWEEN SITUATIONS WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION. FURTHERMORE, OUR PAPER HIGHLIGHTS HOW VARYING OUTCOMES OF THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES AFFECT THE WAY IN WHICH COMPROMISES BETWEEN THE TWO LOGICS ARE MADE. WHILE THE LITERATURE HAS MOSTLY FOCUSED ON EXAMINING HOW COMPROMISES CAN BE DESIGNED INTO THE PMS, WE DRAW ATTENTION TO HOW SITUATION-SPECIFIC COMPROMISES ARE MADE ON THE BASIS OF SUCH PMS.

"DIMITROPOULOS P, 2016, EUR SPORT MANAG Q";"RESEARCH QUESTION: EUROPEAN FOOTBALL CLUBS ARE KNOWN FOR AN INSTITUTIONALIZED MANAGEMENT CULTURE WHICH PRIORITIZES ON-FIELD SUCCESS OVER FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THIS CREATES AN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE CONTEXT WITHIN WHICH MOST CLUBS OPERATE, PRODUCING DEBTS AND DEFICITS. HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO SECURE CLUBS' LONG-TERM FINANCIAL VIABILITY, UNION OF EUROPEAN FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION (UEFA) HAS INTRODUCED REGULATORY AND MONITORING PROCESSES TIED TO ACCOUNTING DATA IN ORDER TO ASSESS CLUBS' FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THIS STUDY AIMS TO DETERMINE WHETHER UEFA'S FRAMEWORK HAS AN IMPACT ON CLUBS' MANAGEMENT POLICIES WITH REGARD TO ACCOUNTING QUALITY.RESEARCH METHODS: THE STUDY EMPLOYS A SAMPLE OF 109 EUROPEAN FOOTBALL CLUBS FOR A SEVEN-YEAR PERIOD, 2008-2014 (THREE YEARS BEFORE AND FOUR YEARS AFTER THE REGULATORY INTERVENTION), TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE REFORM UPON MANAGEMENT PRACTICES RELATED TO ACCOUNTING. FOLLOWING PRIOR LITERATURE, WE EMPLOY THE THREE MOST COMMONLY USED PROXIES OF ACCOUNTING QUALITY: EARNINGS MANAGEMENT, CONDITIONAL ACCOUNTING CONSERVATISM AND AUDITOR SWITCHING.RESULTS AND FINDINGS: THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT, AT THE EXPENSE OF ACCOUNTING QUALITY, CLUB MANAGEMENT SEEKS TO PROMOTE THE IMAGE OF A FINANCIALLY ROBUST ORGANIZATION IN ORDER TO SECURE LICENSING AND, CONSEQUENTLY, MUCH NEEDED FUNDING FROM UEFA. IN THIS MANNER, THE DOMINANCE OF A MANAGEMENT CULTURE WHICH IMPAIRS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS FURTHER CEMENTED.IMPLICATIONS: UEFA SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT, IN A FINANCIALLY DISTRESSED INDUSTRY FOCUSED ON ACHIEVING SUCCESS ON THE FIELD OF PLAY, THE IMPOSITION OF REGULATORY MONITORING TIED TO ACCOUNTING DATA INEVITABLY LEADS TO A LOSS OF ORGANIZATIONAL CREDIBILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. HENCE, UEFA'S INTERVENTION SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY THE IMPOSITION OF A CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK WHICH WOULD AIM TO REARRANGE CLUB MANAGEMENT PRIORITIES BY FACILITATING A CHANGE IN INSTITUTIONALIZED MENTALITIES."
"KULCZYCKI W, 2016, EUR SPORT MANAG Q";"RESEARCH QUESTION: IF RECIPIENTS OF CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) CAMPAIGNS PERCEIVE THEM TO BE MOTIVATED BY PHILANTHROPIC (VS. PROFIT) REASONS, CSR INCREASES IMPORTANT OUTCOME VARIABLES. THIS STUDY LOOKS AT MODERATORS OF THIS RELATIONSHIP IN THE CONTEXT OF PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL TEAMS BASED ON ATTRIBUTION AND EGOCENTRISM THEORY: ONE CSR-SPECIFIC FACTOR (I.E. THE GEOGRAPHICAL FOCUS OF CSR) AND ONE ORGANIZATION-SPECIFIC FACTOR (I.E. THE DIVISION IN WHICH THE TEAMS ARE PLAYING).RESEARCH METHODS: THE STUDY APPLIED A BETWEEN-PARTICIPANT DESIGN, MANIPULATING BOTH THE GEOGRAPHICAL FOCUS OF THE INITIATIVE (LOCAL VS. DISTANT CSR INITIATIVE) AND THE PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL TEAMS THAT CARRIED OUT THE CSR INITIATIVE (FIRST-DIVISION VS. THIRD-DIVISION TEAM). BOTH TEAMS WERE LOCATED IN MUNICH, WHERE 444 CITY RESIDENTS PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. REGRESSION-BASED MODERATION ANALYSES WERE USED TO TEST THE HYPOTHESES.RESULTS AND FINDINGS: PERCEIVED PHILANTHROPIC MOTIVATION FOR CSR HAS A MORE POSITIVE EFFECT ON OUTCOME VARIABLES - INCLUDING THE TEAM'S CSR PERCEPTION, ATTITUDES TOWARD THE TEAM, AND BEHAVIORAL INTENTIONS - FOR THE FIRST-DIVISION TEAM THAN FOR THE THIRD-DIVISION TEAM, AND THIS INTERACTION EFFECT IS PRESENT (ABSENT) IN FIRST-DIVISION TEAM'S DISTANT (LOCAL) CSR ACTIVITIES. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERCEIVED PHILANTHROPIC MOTIVATION AND OUTCOME VARIABLES IS UNAFFECTED BY THE PROXIMITY OF THE SOCIAL CAUSE SUPPORTED BY THE THIRD-DIVISION TEAM.IMPLICATIONS: PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL TEAMS ARE ENCOURAGED TO ACTIVELY MANAGE THEIR PORTFOLIO OF CSR ACTIVITIES TO INCREASE CSR OUTCOMES AS PERCEIVED BY CITY RESIDENTS. HIGHER-DIVISION (VS. LOWER-DIVISION) TEAMS SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT CSR IS PERCEIVED TO BE MOTIVATED BY PHILANTHROPY (AS OPPOSED TO SELF-INTEREST), PARTICULARLY WHEN CSR TAKES PLACE AT DISTANT LOCATIONS."

IN PURSUIT OF THIS AIM, THE RESEARCH FOR THIS PAPER WAS BUILT UPON THE DISCUSSION CONCERNING ``GREEN HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT'' PRACTICES, WHICH EMERGED WITH THE ABILITY-MOTIVATION-OPPORTUNITY THEORETICAL LENS TO EMBED SUSTAINABILITY IN SUCH CENTERS. IT SPECIFIES A SYSTEM OF THE KEY PRACTICES TO IMPLEMENT A CLEANER SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY WITHIN THE SPORTS CENTER THAT HAS MULTIPLE EFFECTS AT THE MACRO, MESO, AND MICRO LEVELS OF SOCIETY. IN AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE LACK OF RESEARCH ON SUCH A SYSTEM, A NOVEL MULTI-METHODS APPROACH WAS IMPLEMENTED IN THREE SECTIONS. THE FIRST SECTION LED TO IDENTIFYING AN INITIAL SEVEN-FACTOR STRUCTURE BASED ON FACTOR ANALYSIS OF A PILOT STUDY WITH NINETY-SEVEN RESPONDENTS FROM THE GREEN COMMUNITY OF JOHOR DARUL TA'ZIM FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION. NEXT, INTERPRETIVE STRUCTURAL MODELING WAS PERFORMED USING A SURVEY OF EXPERTS' JUDGMENT TO DEVELOP THE INITIAL STRUCTURE. FINALLY, STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING WAS CONSIDERED TO TEST THE DEVELOPED MODEL.

"DAVIES RW, 2016, J SPORTS SCI";"GAELIC FOOTBALL AND HURLING ARE TWO SPORTING CODES WITHIN THE GAELIC ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO REPORT THE BODY COMPOSITION PHENOTYPE OF INTER-COUNTY GAELIC ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION PLAYERS, COMPARING GROUPS BY CODE AND FIELD POSITION. 190 SENIOR, MALE, OUTFIELD INTER-COUNTY PLAYERS (144 HURLERS AND 46 GAELIC FOOTBALLERS) WERE RECRUITED. STATURE AND BODY MASS WAS MEASURED, ESTIMATES OF THREE COMPONENTS OF BODY COMPOSITION, I.E. LEAN MASS, FAT MASS AND BONE MINERAL CONTENT WAS OBTAINED BY DUAL ENERGY X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY (DXA), AND NORMATIVE DATA FOR GAELIC ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION ATHLETES BY CODE AND POSITION WAS COMPARED. OTHER THAN IN THE MIDFIELD, THERE WAS LIMITED DIFFERENCE IN BODY COMPOSITION BETWEEN CODES OR PLAYING POSITION. STATURE-CORRECTED INDICES NULLIFIED ANY EXISTING GROUP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MIDFIELDERS FOR BOTH CODES. FURTHER COMPARISONS WITH A NON-ATHLETIC CONTROL GROUP (N=431) SHOWED NO DIFFERENCE FOR BODY MASS INDEX (BMI); HOWEVER, THE ATHLETIC GROUP HAS A LOWER FAT MASS INDEX, WITH A GREATER LEAN MASS IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE MATCHED BMI BETWEEN GROUPS. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN NORMATIVE DATA FOR THE GAELIC ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION ATHLETE, A PROPORTIONAL AND INDEPENDENT TISSUE EVALUATION OF BODY COMPOSITION IS GIVEN."
"ROHDE M, 2016, INT J FINANC STUD";"EUROPE'S ELITE FOOTBALL CLUBS ARE A SMALL GROUP OF ABOUT 30 CLUBS MOSTLY ORIGINATING FROM THE BIG FIVE LEAGUES IN ENGLAND, ITALY, SPAIN, GERMANY, AND FRANCE. THESE CLUBS TOP DELOITTE'S FOOTBALL MONEY LEAGUE RANKING EUROPE'S TOP FOOTBALL CLUBS BY REVENUES. THEY ALSO WIN THE VAST MAJORITY OF NATIONAL AND EUROPEAN FOOTBALL COMPETITIONS, AND ACCOUNT FOR THE MAJOR SHARE OF FIFA WORLD CUP APPEARANCES. NEVERTHELESS, EMPIRICAL ANALYSES STUDYING THE ANTECEDENTS OF FINANCIAL SUCCESS OF THIS PECULIAR SAMPLE ARE RARE. THIS PAPER EXTENDS PREVIOUS RESEARCH BY BUILDING AN EMPIRICAL MODEL OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND APPLYING IT TO A UNIQUE, HIGH-QUALITY DATASET OF THE TOP 30 EU FOOTBALL CLUBS BY CLUB REVENUES ANALYZED OVER TEN CONSECUTIVE SEASONS FROM 2004 TO 2013. FIXED EFFECTS MODELS ARE PERFORMED TO ACCOUNT FOR TIME TRENDS AND CLUB FIXED EFFECTS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT FINANCIAL SUCCESS IS DRIVEN BY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL SPORTING SUCCESS, AS WELL AS BRAND VALUE; SPORTING SUCCESS IS DRIVEN BY TEAM INVESTMENTS, AND TEAM INVESTMENTS TEND TO BE DRIVEN BY (FOREIGN) PRIVATE MAJORITY INVESTORS."
"ERHARDT N, 2016, J INF KNOWL MANAG";"THIS PAPER AIMS TO IDENTIFY TWO DIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT (KM) SYSTEMS AND THEIR UNDERLYING CAPABILITIES BY ACCOUNTING FOR TWO CONTEXTUAL FACTORS: ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES AND TYPE OF KNOWLEDGE. SPECIFICALLY, IT SEEKS TO EXPLORE HOW TWO DIFFERENT ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES (MECHANISTIC AND ORGANIC) SHAPE THE WAY EXPLICIT AND TACIT KNOWLEDGE IS SHARED, CREATED, AND LEARNED. THE PAPER USES A CASE-BASED APPROACH OF TWO SPORTS TEAMS AS ARCHETYPAL CONTEXTS TO INFORM MANAGEMENT RESEARCH. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT A MECHANISTIC STRUCTURE (AMERICAN FOOTBALL) EMPHASISES EXPLICIT KNOWLEDGE FOR SHARING OF SPECIFIC DIRECTIVES, CENTRALISED, INCREMENTAL KNOWLEDGE CREATION, AND ORGANISATIONAL LEARNING THROUGH MEMORISATION AND REPETITIOUS ACTIONS. IN AN ORGANIC STRUCTURE (ICE HOCKEY), SHARING OF TACIT KNOWLEDGE, DECENTRALISED NOVEL KNOWLEDGE CREATION, AND ORGANISATIONAL LEARNING THROUGH EMPOWERED EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING EPISODES ARE EMPHASISED. FINDINGS ILLUSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCOUNTING FOR ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES AND KNOWLEDGE NEEDED FOR DIFFERENT KM SYSTEMS GEARED TOWARDS EFFICIENCY AND ROUTINE WORK, AND FLEXIBILITY AND NON-ROUTINE WORK."
"HERTTING K, 2016, PHYS CULT SPORT STUD RES";"THE OBJECTIVES: THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE USE OF SPORTS AS AN IMPORTANT VENUE FOR ENGAGING CITIZENS IN HEALTH-ENHANCING ACTIVITIES, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, VOLUNTEERISM AND ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP. COACHING IS A CENTRAL COMPONENT OF SPORTS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH, BUT THERE IS LITTLE RESEARCH ON THE PROMOTION OF SPORTS COACHES' HEALTH. IN THE LIGHT OF THIS GAP, THE AIM OF THIS PAPER WAS TO ELUCIDATE YOUTH SOCCER COACHES' VISIONS AND THOUGHTS REGARDING LEADERSHIP SUPPORT FROM CLUBS AND SOCCER ASSOCIATIONS. DESIGN AND METHOD: THE STUDY WAS BASED ON AN ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE CONDUCTED WITH SWEDISH SOCCER COACHES WHO COACHED CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE BETWEEN 6 AND 18 YEARS OF AGE. IN TOTAL, 1514 COACHES RECEIVED THE ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE VIA EMAIL AND 764 COACHES (50.5\% OF THE SAMPLE) ANSWERED. THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-FIVE COACHES ANSWERED THE OPEN QUESTION: `HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE SUPPORT YOU, AS A COACH, WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE FROM CLUBS AND ASSOCIATIONS?' RESPONSES WERE ANALYSED USING METHOD. RESULTS: FOUR MAIN THEMES EMERGED FROM THE ANALYSIS: FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES SUPPORT, RECOGNITION OF CONTRIBUTION, SENSE OF BELONGING TO A VALUE-BASED ASSOCIATION AND POSITIVE COACH DEVELOPMENT. CONCLUSION: WE DISCUSS THE FACTORS THAT SUPPORT SOCCER COACHES AND HOW THESE CAN SERVE AS HEALTH-PROMOTING SUPPORTS FOR COACHES WORKING WITH CHILDREN AND YOUTH."

"ROACH M, 2016, J SPORT MANAGE";"SPORTS FRANCHISES OFTEN VALUE PRIOR HEAD COACHING EXPERIENCE AS THEY EVALUATE HEAD COACHING CANDIDATES. THIS PAPER EMPIRICALLY TESTS WHETHER PRIOR HEAD COACHING EXPERIENCE AFFECTS TEAM PERFORMANCE IN THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE. ACCOUNTING FOR INDIVIDUAL COACH EFFECTS AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS, I FIND THAT TEAM PERFORMANCE IS SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE BEYOND A GIVEN COACH'S INITIAL HEAD COACHING SPELL. THESE RESULTS HOLD FOR A VARIETY OF OUTCOME MEASURES. WHILE COACHES WITH THE LOWEST LEVELS OF SUCCESS IN THEIR INITIAL HEAD COACHING SPELL HAVE THE MOST PRONOUNCED NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE EFFECTS, SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECTS ARE ESTIMATED FOR COACHES AT ALL LEVELS OF INITIAL SUCCESS. ONE EXPLANATION FOR THESE RESULTS IS THAT HUMAN CAPITAL ACQUIRED THROUGH HEAD COACHING EXPERIENCE IS TO A LARGE EXTENT FIRM SPECIFIC, SO WHILE LEARNING DOES OCCUR WITHIN A GIVEN HEAD COACHING JOB, IT DOES NOT CARRY OVER TO FUTURE COACHING SPELLS. THIS CAN LEAD TO AN EROSION OF ANY RELATIVE HUMAN CAPITAL ADVANTAGE."

PREDICTIVE VALUE OF NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE SCOUTING COMBINE ON FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF RUNNING BACKS AND WIDE RECEIVERS. J STRENGTH COND RES 30(5): 1379-1390, 2016THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE (NFL) SCOUTING COMBINE IS HELD EACH YEAR BEFORE THE NFL DRAFT TO MEASURE ATHLETIC ABILITIES AND FOOTBALL SKILLS OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYERS. ALTHOUGH THE NFL SCOUTING COMBINE CAN PROVIDE THE NFL TEAMS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE COLLEGE PLAYERS FOR THE UPCOMING NFL DRAFT, ITS VALUE FOR PREDICTING FUTURE SUCCESS OF PLAYERS HAS BEEN QUESTIONED. THIS STUDY EXAMINED WHETHER THE NFL COMBINE MEASURES CAN PREDICT FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF RUNNING BACKS (RBS) AND WIDE RECEIVERS (WRS) IN THE NFL. WE ANALYZED THE 2000-09 COMBINE DATA OF RBS (N = 276) AND WRS (N = 447) AND THEIR ON-FIELD PERFORMANCE FOR THE FIRST 3 YEARS AFTER THE DRAFT AND OVER THEIR ENTIRE CAREERS IN THE NFL, USING CORRELATION AND REGRESSION ANALYSES, ALONG WITH A PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA). THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSES SHOWED THAT, AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR THE NUMBER OF GAMES PLAYED, DRAFT POSITION, HEIGHT (HT), AND WEIGHT (WT), THE TIME ON 10-YARD DASH WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT PREDICTOR OF RUSHING YARDS PER ATTEMPT OF THE FIRST 3 YEARS (P = 0.002) AND OF THE CAREERS (P < 0.001) IN RBS. FOR WRS, VERTICAL JUMP WAS FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH RECEIVING YARDS PER RECEPTION OF THE FIRST 3 YEARS (P = 0.001) AND OF THE CAREERS (P = 0.004) IN THE NFL, AFTER ADJUSTING FOR THE COVARIATES ABOVE. FURTHERMORE, HT WAS MOST IMPORTANT IN PREDICTING FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF WRS. THE ANALYSES ALSO REVEALED THAT THE 8 ATHLETIC DRILLS IN THE COMBINE SEEMED TO HAVE CONSTRUCT VALIDITY. IT SEEMS THAT THE NFL SCOUTING COMBINE HAS SOME VALUE FOR PREDICTING FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF RBS AND WRS IN THE NFL."
"LAGO-PENAS C, 2016, J HUM KINET";"THE AIM OF THE CURRENT STUDY WAS (I) TO IDENTIFY HOW IMPORTANT WAS A GOOD SEASON START IN RELATION TO ELITE HANDBALL TEAMS' PERFORMANCE, AND (II) TO EXAMINE IF THIS IMPACT WAS RELATED TO THE CLUBS' FINANCIAL BUDGET. THE MATCH PERFORMANCES AND ANNUAL BUDGETS OF ALL TEAMS WERE COLLECTED FROM THE SPANISH PROFESSIONAL HANDBALL LEAGUE DURING TEN SEASONS. THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RANKING OF EACH TEAM IN ACCORDANCE TO THE ANNUAL BUDGET AND THE RANKING OF EACH TEAM AT THE END OF THE SEASON. A K-MEANS CLUSTER ANALYSIS CLASSIFIED THE CLUBS ACCORDING TO THEIR BUDGET AS HIGH RANGE BUDGET CLUBS (HRBC), UPPER-MID RANGE BUDGET CLUBS (UMRBC), LOWER-MID RANGE BUDGET CLUBS (LMRBC) AND LOW RANGE BUDGET CLUBS (LRBC). DATA WERE EXAMINED THROUGH LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS. OVERALL, THE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT THE BETTER THE TEAM PERFORMANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON, THE BETTER THE RANKING AT THE END OF THE SEASON. EACH POSITION IN THE RANKING ABOVE EXPECTED IN ACCORDANCE TO THE BUDGET OF THE TEAMS IN ROUNDS 3, 4 OR 5 IMPROVED BY 0.47, 0.50 OR 0.49, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE RANKING AT THE END OF THE SEASON (P<0.05). HOWEVER, THE IMPACT OF THE EFFECT DEPENDED ON THE CLUBS' ANNUAL BUDGET. FOR UMRBC, LMRBC AND LRBC A GOOD START TO THE SEASON HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE FINAL OUTCOME (P<0.05). NEVERTHELESS, FOR HRBC, A GOOD OR A BAD START OF THE SEASON DID NOT EXPLAIN THEIR FINAL POSITION. THESE VARIABLES CAN BE USED TO DEVELOP ACCURATE MODELS TO ESTIMATE FINAL RANKINGS.

"NAIDENOVA I, 2016, EUR SPORT MANAG Q";"RESEARCH QUESTION: THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES HOW FOOTBALL SPONSORSHIP INFLUENCES THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF SPONSORS. WE SUGGEST A NEW INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE (IV) TO AVOID ENDOGENEITY. RESEARCH METHODS: WE USE AN IV REGRESSION FRAMEWORK COMBINED WITH A FIXED EFFECTS MODEL. THE NUMBER OF TWEETS CONTAINING BOTH TEAM AND SPONSOR NAMES ARE COLLECTED TO USE AS THE IV. RESULTS AND FINDINGS: WE ANALYZE TOP EUROPEAN LEAGUES. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT FOOTBALL SPONSORSHIP IS MORE CHARITY THAN COMMERCIAL INVESTMENT. THE ANALYSIS OF DETERMINANTS OF BECOMING A SPONSOR AND SPONSORSHIP AMOUNT SHOWS THAT COMPANIES OWNED BY INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BECOME A SPONSOR. IMPLICATIONS: SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD BE AWARE OF SPONSORSHIP DEALS, AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT SHOULD ANALYZE THE FINANCIAL ASSUMPTIONS OF SUCH PROJECTS CAREFULLY."

THE CORPUS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH ON THE TOPIC REMAINS, HOWEVER, LARGELY CONCERNED WITH (A) PRODUCING OF FORMAL TAXONOMIES OF FANS, AND (B) MAKING THE ANALYTIC DISTINCTION BETWEEN AUTHENTIC ``FANS'' AND MERE ``SPECTATORS.'' THIS WORK IS PREMISED ON THE CLASSICAL BUT PROBLEMATIC SOCIAL-COGNITIVE ASSUMPTION THAT IDENTITY ITSELF BOTH PRECEDES AND (LARGELY) DETERMINES THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS COMMUNICATED. AS SUCH, THE CORE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO TAKE PROVISIONAL EMPIRICAL STEPS TOWARDS A FORMAL PSYCHOLOGY OF ``AUTHENTIC'' SPORTING FANDOM THAT DOES NOT REPLICATE THIS TROUBLESOME ASSUMPTION. DESIGN: A DISCURSIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK IS USED TO EXPLORE HOW SELF IDENTIFIED SOCCER FANS MAKE ``ROBUST'' CASES FOR THE AUTHENTICITY OF THEIR OWN FAN-IDENTITIES. METHOD: N = 26 UNSTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS ARE ANALYSED TO HIGHLIGHT THE CONSTRUCTIVE AND ATTRIBUTIONAL TECHNIQUES DRAWN UPON BY SPEAKERS WHEN MAKING CASES, AND THE CULTURALLY-AVAILABLE KNOWLEDGES AND CONTEXTUAL REASONING PROCEDURES THAT THESE MAKE APPARENT. RESULTS: THREE MODELS FOR LEGITIMATING FAN-IDENTITY ARE DESCRIBED: (A) LONGITUDINAL ENDURANCE, (B) LOGICAL CHOICE-MAKING AND (C) EMOTIONAL IMPERATIVE. IT IS NOTED HOW KEY ISSUES THAT INFORM SOCIAL-COGNITIVE ANALYSIS ARE ACTUALLY ASSEMBLED AS MEMBERS' CONCERNS IN THE SERVICE OF PERSUASIVELY ACCOUNTING FOR PARTICULAR CLAIMS IN SITU, AND THAT THIS CAN FACILITATE A STRONGER UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTERRELATION BETWEEN SPORTING CULTURE AND SOCIAL IDENTITY ITSELF. CONCLUSIONS: UNTIL A STRONGER DESCRIPTION OF PUBLIC PROCEDURES FOR SELF-IDENTIFICATION IS ADVANCED, ANALYTIC ABSTRACTIONS MADE FOR THE SAKE OF ``CLARITY'' CAN GUARANTEE NO RELEVANCE TO THE SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL LIVES OF EVERYDAY FANS THEMSELVES.

DESPITE THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR INCLUDING SOCIAL FORMS OF INFLUENCE SUCH AS SOCIAL SUPPORT AND SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE AS DIRECT SOURCES OF SPORT COMMITMENT, EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE HAS NOT BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THIS ASSOCIATION. THEREFORE, DIRECT AND INDIRECT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TEAMMATE ACCEPTANCE AND SPORT COMMITMENT WITHIN THE SCM WERE TESTED. FINDINGS SUPPORTED THE INDIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TEAMMATE ACCEPTANCE AND SPORT COMMITMENT THROUGH SPORT ENJOYMENT, PERSONAL INVESTMENTS, SOCIAL CONSTRAINTS, AND INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR 48\% OF THE VARIANCE IN SPORT COMMITMENT. IT APPEARS THAT TEAMMATE ACCEPTANCE MAY BE BETTER SITUATED AS A DISTAL SOURCE OF SPORT COMMITMENT, BUT FURTHER RESEARCH WITH MORE DIVERSE SAMPLES IS NECESSARY.

PREVIOUSLY, FINANCIAL REPORTS HAVE NOT BEEN USED TO SUPPORT OR REFUTE SUCH CLAIMS. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS FINDINGS FROM A DETAILED EXAMINATION OF THE FINANCIAL REPORTS AND OTHER RECORDS OF SIX OF THE 10 VFL CLUBS FOR THE YEARS SURROUNDING THE LEGALIZATION OF PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL IN 1911 (1909-1912). PRIOR TO 1911, MOST CLUBS ENGAGED IN FRAUDULENT FINANCIAL REPORTING PRACTICES BY MISREPRESENTING PLAYER PAYMENTS AS OTHER FORMS OF PERMITTED EXPENDITURES, THUS CONCEALING PROHIBITED REMUNERATIVE PAYMENTS TO PLAYERS WITHIN THEIR FINANCIAL REPORTS. USING ISOMORPHIC INFLUENCES TO EXPLAIN THE REASONS FOR THIS MISREPRESENTATION, WE CONCLUDE THAT THE FINANCIAL REPORTS WERE USED TO LEGITIMATE THE MAJORITY OF CLUBS AS AMATEUR ORGANIZATIONS. COMPETING ISOMORPHIC PRESSURES, PARTICULARLY CONFLICTING COERCIVE FACTORS RELATED TO THE VFL'S PROHIBITION ON PLAYER PAYMENTS AND NORMATIVE PRESSURES ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASING PROFESSIONALISM AMONGST PLAYERS, CONTRIBUTED TO CLUBS ENGAGING IN FRAUDULENT FINANCIAL REPORTING."

"NICOLIELLO M, 2016, SPORT BUS MANAG";"PURPOSE - IN 2009, THE UNION OF EUROPEAN FOOTBALL ASSOCIATIONS APPROVED THE FINANCIAL FAIR PLAY (FFP) REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATIONS REFER TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF TRANSPARENCY AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS FOR FOOTBALL CLUBS PARTICIPATING IN EUROPEAN COMPETITIONS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO COMBINE THE MANAGERIAL AND THE ECONOMIC POINTS-OF-VIEW IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND IF ITALIAN FOOTBALL CLUBS ARE READY TO COMPLY WITH THE NEW FFP RULES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - IN THE ANALYSIS, THE AUTHORS FOCUS ON THE MAIN ITALIAN FOOTBALL LEAGUE, SERIE A. USING BUSINESS MODEL ANALYSIS, THE AUTHORS DETERMINE WHAT THE MAIN PROFIT DETERMINANTS OF FOOTBALL ASSOCIATIONS ARE, THROUGH PANEL DATA FOR 15 CLUBS FROM 2011-2013. THE AUTHORS THEN TRY TO MATCH THE STATISTICAL AND MANAGERIAL APPROACH. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE KEY CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO PROFITS ARE ON THE COSTS SIDE. IN PARTICULAR, THE MOST RELEVANT EXPENSES ARE PLAYER WAGES. THE CORE REVENUE FOR CLUBS COMES FROM THE NET PROFIT FROM PLAYER TRADING, WHILE OTHER INCOME, SUCH AS TV RIGHTS, COMMERCIAL AND MATCH-DAY PROCEEDS, HAVE NO STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR PROFIT FORMATION. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE MAIN LIMITATION OF THE ANALYSIS IS THAT THE SURVEY REGARDED ONLY ON ITALIAN CHAMPIONSHIP. SO IT IS DEEPLY INFLUENCED BY THE COMPETITIVE STRUCTURE OF THE ITALIAN LEAGUE THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF OTHER EUROPEAN LEAGUES. THEREFORE, THE AUTHORS THINK THAT THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS OF THIS WORK COULD BE THE EXAMINATION OF ANOTHER EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP, FOR EXAMPLE, ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE, AND THE COMPARED ANALYSIS OF ITALIAN LEAGUE AND OTHER EUROPEAN ONE. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THERE IS A CLOSE-LINK BETWEEN COSTS AND PROFITABILITY, AND ESPECIALLY BETWEEN EXPENDITURE ON PLAYERS AND THE ABILITY TO CLOSE THE FINANCIAL YEAR WITH A PROFIT. CLUBS MUST ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF PLAYER WAGES IN ORDER TO FOLLOW A PATH OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY TOWARDS PROFITABILITY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - IN THE WORK THE AUTHORS PUT TOGETHER MANAGERIAL POINT OF VIEW AND ECONOMICAL ONE, IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW FFP CAN IMPACT ON PROFITABILITY OF FOOTBALL CLUBS.

THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY OF EUROPEAN HOCKEY TO USE BETTING MARKET ODDS TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF HOME TEAM WIN PROBABILITY AND UNCERTAINTY OF OUTCOME ON ATTENDANCE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE DESIGN OF THIS STUDY IS A MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION MODEL WITH LOG OF ATTENDANCE AND PERCENTAGE OF ARENA CAPACITY AS DEPENDENT VARIABLES IN TWO SEPARATE REGRESSIONS. CONTROLLING FOR OTHER FACTORS, THE ROLE OF THE HOME TEAM WIN PROBABILITY AND ITS SQUARE ARE EXPLORED FOR INDIVIDUAL GAME ATTENDANCE. FINDINGS - FANS OF THE KHL AND SHL ARE FOUND TO PREFER TO SEE THEIR HOME TEAM WIN, BUT ALSO EXHIBIT STRONG PREFERENCES FOR UNCERTAINTY OF OUTCOME. FANS OF LIIGA PREFER TO SEE THE HOME TEAM WIN, BUT DO NOT EXHIBIT AS STRONG A PREFERENCE FOR UNCERTAINTY OF OUTCOME. THIS DIFFERS FROM RECENT FINDINGS IN THE SPORT OF BASEBALL AND FROM PREVIOUS FINDINGS FOR THE NHL. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - HAVING A COMPETITIVE LEAGUE IS NOT ONLY IMPORTANT FOR TELEVISION RATINGS, BUT ALSO FOR IN-PERSON ATTENDANCE IN THESE EUROPEAN HOCKEY LEAGUES. IMPORTANCE OF UNCERTAINTY OF OUTCOME VARIES ACROSS LEAGUES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE PAPER USES FINANCIAL MARKET PRICES, BETTING MARKET ODDS, AS A MEASURE OF GAME EXPECTATIONS (HOME TEAM WIN PROBABILITY) AND UNCERTAINTY OF OUTCOME AND APPLIES IT TO A NEW SETTING FOR THREE OF THE TOP EUROPEAN HOCKEY LEAGUES. THE FINDINGS ILLUSTRATE THAT UNCERTAINTY OF OUTCOME IS IMPORTANT FOR THE KHL AND SHL, BUT STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT FOR LIIGA."

MOREOVER, THE STATIC AND DYNAMIC REGRESSION MODELS, AS WELL AS THE FIXED EFFECTS PANEL DATA MODELS, SUPPORT THE NOTION OF BUDGETED REVENUES BEING A DRIVER OF SPORTING OUTCOME.IMPLICATIONS: THE DUALITY IN THE RESULTS IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY THE FIXED EFFECTS MODELS, INDICATING THAT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OTHER THAN FINANCIAL ADVANTAGES ARE RELEVANT. AN INTERPRETATION OF THESE FINDINGS IS THAT MONEY IS A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF SPORTING SUCCESS, BUT ONLY TO A CERTAIN EXTENT (I.E. AVOIDING RELEGATION).

WHILE POTENTIAL OUTCOMES OF THE CONCEPT HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY ASSESSED, THERE IS LITTLE RESEARCH ON THE GENESIS AND BACKGROUND BEHIND ITS IMPLEMENTATION. THE PRESENT PAPER FILLS THIS GAP BY ANALYZING THE DISCOURSE IN THE RUN-UP TO THE PASSAGE OF FFP. WE FOCUS ON INTERPRETED PRACTICE AND CONTEXT AND ARGUE THAT THE RISING INDEBTEDNESS OF CLUBS AND THEIR INCREASING RELIANCE ON BENEFACTORS WERE A NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT REQUIREMENT. FURTHER INGREDIENTS IMPERATIVE FOR THE SUCCESSFUL POLICY DEVELOPMENT WERE CLAIMS-MAKING ACTIVITIES BY INFLUENTIAL ACTORS TO SECURE SUPPORT FOR THEIR PROBLEM PERCEPTION. STRONG DISCOURSE COALITIONS WERE FORMED AROUND POWERFUL STORYLINES, SUCH AS THE INTERPRETATION OF MAKING DEBTS AS `CHEATING' AS WELL AS THE NOTION OF TRADITIONAL SPORTING VALUES BEING UNDERMINED BY FINANCIAL FORCES. BY DETECTING SUCH MECHANISMS OF INTERACTION, THE STUDY HELPS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE BELIEFS AND IDEOLOGIES UNDERPINNING THE POLICY. IT FURTHERMORE IDENTIFIES DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN PUBLIC DISCOURSE AND SCHOLARLY DEBATE CONCERNING THE PROBLEM ASSESSMENT AS WELL AS THE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS.

METHODS: COMMERCIALS DURING THE NFL SUPER BOWL 2015 WERE ASSESSED FOR VIOLENT AND RISKY BEHAVIORS. ADDITIONAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS WERE INDICATED SUCH AS THE ADVERTISEMENT OF UNHEALTHY FOOD, PROMOTION OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND SEXUAL CONTENT. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 110 COMMERCIALS WERE DOCUMENTED, ACCOUNTING FOR 64 MINUTES OF BROADCAST TIME. COMMERCIALS PROMOTING AUTOMOBILES, TELEVISION SHOWS, FOOD, AND MOVIES WERE THE MOST PREVALENT, REPRESENTING JUST OVER HALF (53.7\%) OF ALL OF THE ADVERTISEMENTS FEATURED. DEPICTIONS OF UNSAFE DRIVING WERE FOUND IN 10.9\% (N = 12) OF THE COMMERCIALS. ALL 12 COMMERCIALS CONTAINED SOME SORT OF RISKY OR WILD DRIVING BEHAVIOR, AND SPEEDING WAS OBSERVED IN 11 OF THE 12 COMMERCIALS. A TOTAL OF 32 (29.1\%) OF THE COMMERCIALS WERE CODED AS INCLUDING VIOLENT CONTENT. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIOR WAS PRESENT IN 3 (2.7\%) OF THE COMMERCIALS. CONVERSELY, SUBSTANCE USE WAS OBSERVED IN 3 (2.7\%) OF THE COMMERCIALS, NONE OF WHICH INCLUDED HEALTH PROMOTION MESSAGING. OF THE 110 COMMERCIALS AIRED DURING THE 2015 SUPER BOWL, 12.7\% (N = 14) INCLUDED SEXUAL CONTENT. CONCLUSION: PARENTS SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEIR CHILDREN MAY OBSERVE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR CONFLICTING SAFETY MESSAGES DURING COMMERCIAL BREAKS."

OUR ANALYSIS HAS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES. FIRST, WE MEASURE THE DIRECT IMPACT OF INCREASED FINANCIAL COMMITMENT. SECOND, WE ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF SUNK COSTS WHEN FIRMS HAVE ACCURATE AND ABUNDANT PERFORMANCE FEEDBACK; THEREFORE, OUR CONCLUSIONS ARE NOT DRIVEN BY UNCERTAINTY. FINALLY, WE CONTROL FOR POSSIBLE ENDOGENEITY BY USING THE EXOGENOUS VARIATION IN COMPENSATION GENERATED WHEN PLAYERS BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR FREE AGENCY OR CHANGE TEAMS. OUR RESULTS INDICATE SUNK COSTS ARE SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANTS OF PLAYER UTILIZATION. A 15 \% INCREASE IN COMPENSATION HAS AN EQUIVALENT EFFECT ON PLAYING TIME AS AN INCREASE OF FIVE TO ELEVEN SOLO TACKLES, ONE TO TWO INTERCEPTIONS AND TWO TO FIVE AND A HALF SACKS IN THE PREVIOUS SEASON FOR LINEBACKERS, DEFENSIVE BACKS AND DEFENSIVE LINEMEN RESPECTIVELY.

ANTHROPOMETRIC VARIABLES INCLUDED BODY FAT PERCENTAGE AND THIGH GIRTH. STRENGTH WAS QUANTIFIED AS THE PEAK ECCENTRIC HAMSTRING TORQUE AT 180, 300, AND 60 DEGREES.S(-1). MEAN REACTION TIME AND ACCURACY IN THE STROOP WORD-COLOUR TEST WAS USED TO ASSESS PERCEPTUAL AND DECISION MAKING FACTORS. RESULTS. THERE WAS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF INTERTEST CORRELATION WITH THE STRONGEST RELATIONSHIP OBSERVED BETWEEN 10 M SPRINT AND T-TEST PERFORMANCE (R(2)=0.49, P<0.01). ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES WERE NOT STRONG PREDICTORS OF AGILITY, ACCOUNTING FOR A MAXIMUM 23\% (P=0.12) IN THE PRESCRIPTIVE CHANGE-OF-DIRECTION TEST. COGNITIVE MEASURES HAD A STRONGER CORRELATION WITH THE REACTIVE (RATHER THAN PRESCRIPTIVE) AGILITY TESTS, WITH A MAXIMUM 33\% (P=0.04) OF VARIANCE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE REACTIVE CHANGE-OF-DIRECTION TEST. ECCENTRIC HAMSTRING STRENGTH ACCOUNTED FOR 62\% (P=0.01) OF THE VARIANCE IN THE PRESCRIPTIVE CHANGE-OF-DIRECTION TEST. HIERARCHICAL ORDERING OF THE AGILITY TESTS REVEALED THAT ECCENTRIC HAMSTRING STRENGTH WAS THE PRIMARY PREDICTOR IN 3 OF THE 4 TESTS, WITH COGNITIVE ACCURACY THE NEXT MOST COMMON PREDICTOR. CONCLUSION. THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF INTER-TEST CORRELATION ACROSS A BATTERY OF AGILITY TESTS. ECCENTRIC HAMSTRING STRENGTH AND DECISION MAKING ACCURACY ARE THE MOST COMMON PREDICTORS OF AGILITY PERFORMANCE."

THIS QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH STUDY ANALYZED UNIVERSITIES' OVERALL PRIVATE CONTRIBUTIONS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF OVERALL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE INSTITUTIONS FOLLOWING A YEAR OF ATHLETICS SUCCESS. FOR THIS STUDY, ATHLETICS SUCCESS INCLUDED PARTICIPATION IN EITHER THE DIVISION I (DI) MEN'S BASKETBALL NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION (NCAA) FINAL FOUR OR DI FOOTBALL BOWL SUBDIVISION (FBS) BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES (BCS) BOWL GAME. THE STUDY FOCUSED ON A PERIOD OF 10 YEARS (2002-2011) USING A SAMPLE OF 129 OBSERVATIONS (COUNCIL FOR AID TO EDUCATION'S [CAE] VOLUNTARY SUPPORT OF EDUCATION [VSE] SURVEY)-SATISFYING THE CRITERIA ABOVE, THEN COMPARING THEM WITH THE BASELINE (ALL INSTITUTIONS) DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CHANGE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF OVERALL CONTRIBUTION WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT OVER A 2-YEAR PERIOD. THE RESULTS SHOW A SIGNIFICANT STATISTICAL DIFFERENCE OF MORE THAN DOUBLE IN THE PERCENT INCREASE OF OVERALL PRIVATE CONTRIBUTIONS FOR INSTITUTIONS WITH ATHLETICS SUCCESS COMPARED WITH ALL HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. FURTHERMORE, A SMALL STATISTICAL DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND FOR THE ATHLETICS SUCCESS IN PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS COMPARED WITH PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS THAT EXPERIENCED SIMILAR ATHLETICS SUCCESS. NO DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND BY REGION, FOR HISTORY OF ATHLETICS SUCCESS, OR BETWEEN BASKETBALL OR FOOTBALL ATHLETICS SUCCESS FOR THOSE INSTITUTIONS EXPERIENCING ATHLETICS SUCCESS. THE STUDY CONCLUDED THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERALL PRIVATE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR INSTITUTIONS THAT EXPERIENCE ATHLETICS SUCCESS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH A PRIVATE AFFILIATION."
"GUERTLER O, 2015, J SPORT ECON";"THE RELEASE OF PLAYERS FROM A CLUB TO THE NATIONAL TEAM OFTEN LEADS TO A CONFLICT CONCERNING THE DURATION OF THE PLAYERS' STAY WITH THE NATIONAL TEAM. BASED ON A THEORETICAL BARGAINING MODEL, WE EXAMINE WHETHER INTERVENTION IN THIS CONFLICT BY A GOVERNING BODY IS DESIRABLE. WE SHOW THAT BARGAINING BETWEEN THE CLUB AND THE NATIONAL FEDERATION YIELDS A SOCIALLY INEFFICIENT OUTCOME IF FINANCIAL COMPENSATION IS EITHER PROHIBITED OR LIMITED. IF, HOWEVER, THE NATIONAL FEDERATION IS ALLOWED TO PAY UNLIMITED FINANCIAL COMPENSATION TO THE CLUB, IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO INTERVENE IN THE NEGOTIATIONS BECAUSE THE BARGAINING OUTCOME WILL BE SOCIALLY OPTIMAL."
"MEGANCK J, 2015, HEALTH EDUC J";"SETTING AND OBJECTIVE: FOR DECADES, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION HAS PROMOTED SETTINGS-BASED HEALTH PROMOTION, BUT ITS APPLICATION TO LEISURE SETTINGS IS MINIMAL. FOCUSING ON ORGANISED SPORTS AS AN IMPORTANT LEISURE ACTIVITY, THE PRESENT STUDY HAD THREE GOALS: EXPLORING THE HEALTH PROMOTION PROFILE OF YOUTH SPORTS CLUBS, IDENTIFYING OBJECTIVE CLUB CHARACTERISTICS (E.G. SIZE, TYPE OF SPORT), PREDICTING THE PRESENCE/ABSENCE OF HEALTH PROMOTION IN YOUTH SPORTS CLUBS AND IDENTIFYING PERCEIVED MOTIVES AND BARRIERS TO HEALTH PROMOTION IN YOUTH SPORTS CLUBS, THEREBY IMPROVING THE BASIS FOR POLICY GUIDELINES. METHOD: RESPONDENTS WERE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE BOARD OF 154 YOUTH SPORTS CLUBS. DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH AN ONLINE SURVEY, INCLUDING THE HEALTH-PROMOTING SPORTS CLUB INDEX (HPSC-I). LINEAR REGRESSION AND ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WERE USED TO IDENTIFY PREDICTORS AND DIFFERENCES. RESULTS: EVEN THOUGH THE MOTIVES WERE STRONGLY SUPPORTED, A MAJORITY OF YOUTH SPORTS CLUBS WERE RATED AS LOW HEALTH PROMOTING ON THE HPSC-I (59\%). OVERALL, LINEAR REGRESSION INDICATED THAT CLUBS FOUNDED MORE RECENTLY, OFFERING MULTIPLE TYPES OF SPORTS AND OFFERING BOTH RECREATION AND COMPETITION SCORED HIGHER ON THE HEALTH PROMOTION INDICES. HEALTH PROMOTION NOT BEING A PRIORITY OF THE BOARD AND LACK OF EXPERTISE WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE MOST IMPORTANT BARRIERS. CONCLUSION: PROGRESS IS NEEDED BEFORE YOUTH SPORTS CLUBS CAN TRULY BE CONSIDERED HEALTH-PROMOTING SETTINGS. POLICY SUGGESTIONS ARE MADE TO ADDRESS THE BARRIERS, FOR EXAMPLE, FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO MAXIMISE EFFORTS AND ESTABLISHING COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN SPORTS CLUBS AND HEALTH PROMOTION EXPERTS."
"ESSON J, 2015, GEOFORUM";"THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO CONTEMPORARY DEBATES OVER THE RESOURCEFULNESS AND ENTREPRENEURIALISM OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH BY EXPLORING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT AND THE MIGRATION OF MALE YOUTH WITHIN THE FOOTBALL INDUSTRY. DRAWING ON FIELDWORK IN ACCRA, THE PAPER REVEALS HOW YOUNG GHANAIANS ATTEMPT TO ENACT DEVELOPMENT AS FREEDOM THROUGH SPATIAL MOBILITY. SIGNIFICANTLY, THIS IS COUPLED WITH AN AWARENESS THAT THEIR DESIRED SPATIAL MOBILITY IS DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN, THEREBY INDUCING A SENSE OF INVOLUNTARY IMMOBILITY. FOR SOME MALE YOUTH, THE SOLUTION TO THIS PREDICAMENT IS TO INVEST IN THEIR SPORTING BODILY CAPITAL AND BECOME FOUCAULDIAN `ENTREPRENEURS OF SELF' IN THE FORM OF A PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLER. MEANWHILE FOR OTHERS, THE SOLUTION TO PREVAILING ECONOMIC PRESSURES IS TO EMBRACE FINANCIAL RISK BY BECOMING ENTREPRENEURS IN THE FORM OF FOOTBALL CLUB OWNERS, AND ATTEMPTING TO PROFIT FROM THE MOVEMENT OF PLAYERS. THE INTERESTS OF THESE TWO SETS OF ENTREPRENEURS COALESCE AROUND THE FACT THAT THE MOBILITY OF FOOTBALLERS IS CRUCIAL TO GENERATING A RETURN ON THEIR RESPECTIVE INVESTMENTS. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF YOUNG GHANAIANS AS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR FUTURE LIFE CHANCES, AND THE GROWING DISSONANCE BETWEEN ASPIRATIONS AND THE ABILITY TO MIGRATE, IS A KEY REASON WHY YOUTH ARE TRYING TO MIGRATE THROUGH FOOTBALL. PROBLEMATICALLY, THIS CAN FOSTER CONDITIONS FAVOURABLE FOR IRREGULAR MIGRATION. (C) 2015 THE AUTHOR. PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER LTD."
"BUDZINSKI O, 2015, J COMPET LAW ECON";"IN THIS ARTICLE, WE DISCUSS, FROM AN ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE, TWO ALTERNATIVE VIEWS OF RESTRICTIONS OF COMPETITION BY SPORTS ASSOCIATIONS. THE HORIZONTAL APPROACH VIEWS SUCH RESTRICTIONS AS AN AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTICIPANTS OF A SPORTS LEAGUE WITH THE SPORTS ASSOCIATION MERELY REPRESENTING AN ORGANIZATION EXECUTING THE HORIZONTAL COOPERATION. IN CONTRAST, THE VERTICAL APPROACH VIEWS THE SPORTS ASSOCIATION AS BEING A DOMINANT UPSTREAM FIRM ENJOYING A MONOPOLY POSITION ON THE MARKET STAGE FOR COMPETITION ORGANIZING SERVICES, AN IMPORTANT INPUT FOR THE ACTUAL PRODUCT-THE SPORTS GAME. TAKING THE RECENT FINANCIAL FAIR PLAY (FFP) INITIATIVE BY UEFA (THE UNION OF EUROPEAN FOOTBALL ASSOCIATIONS) AS AN EXAMPLE, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE DIFFERENT VIEWS LEAD TO DIFFERENT ASSESSMENTS OF RESTRICTIVE EFFECTS AND, THUS, MATTER FOR COMPETITION POLICY DECISIONS. THE ECONOMIC STORY OF THE POTENTIAL RESTRICTIVE EFFECT OF FFP ON PLAYERS' AND PLAYER AGENTS' INCOME MAY FIT MORE PLAUSIBLY TO THE HORIZONTAL APPROACH, WHEREAS THE POTENTIALLY ANTICOMPETITIVE FORECLOSURE AND DETERRENCE EFFECTS OF FFP MAY BE ECONOMICALLY MORE SOUNDLY REASONED BY TAKING THE VERTICAL APPROACH."

OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SLOTS THAT A NATIONAL LEAGUE GETS IN THE CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE LEADS TO INCREASES IN INVESTMENT IN TALENT EX ANTE. THIS EFFECT IS LARGEST AMONG THE TEAMS THAT IN THE PREVIOUS SEASON JUST FAILED TO QUALIFY. THIS SUGGESTS THAT CHANGES IN PRIZE STRUCTURE LEADS TO CHANGES IN INVESTMENT DECISIONS AMONGST THOSE CLUBS MOST AFFECTED AT THE MARGIN.

"GABBETT TJ, 2015, J STRENGTH COND RES";"MOST INVESTIGATIONS OF THE ACTIVITY PROFILES OF RUGBY LEAGUE MATCH-PLAY HAVE REPORTED THE PHYSICAL DEMANDS ACROSS THE ENTIRE MATCH IRRESPECTIVE OF STOPPAGES IN PLAY. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE ACTIVITY PROFILES OF RUGBY LEAGUE MATCH-PLAY, ACCOUNTING FOR TIME WHEN THE BALL WAS ``IN'' AND ``OUT-OF-PLAY.'' ONE-HUNDRED FOUR PLAYERS (MEAN AGE, 24.0 +/- 3.0 YEARS) FROM 11 SEMIPROFESSIONAL RUGBY LEAGUE TEAMS UNDERWENT GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM ANALYSIS DURING 22 MATCHES. MATCHES WERE CODED FOR ACTIVITY AND RECOVERY CYCLES. TIME WHEN THE BALL WAS CONTINUOUSLY IN PLAY WAS CONSIDERED ACTIVITY, WHEREAS ANY STOPPAGES DURING THE MATCH (E.G., FOR SCRUMS, PENALTIES, LINE DROP-OUTS, AND TRIES) WERE CONSIDERED RECOVERY. THE RELATIVE DISTANCE (125.1 +/- 16.1 M.MIN(-1) VS. 86.7 +/ - 9.8 M.MIN(-1)), LOW-SPEED ACTIVITY (115.3 +/- 15.7 M.MIN(-1) VS. 81.7 +/- 9.8 M.MIN(-1)), AND HIGH-SPEED RUNNING (9.5 +/- 2.9 M.MIN(-1) VS. 5.0 +/- 1.8 M.MIN(-1)) DEMANDS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.0001) HIGHER WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR BALL-IN-PLAY TIME. THE FREQUENCY OF COLLISIONS (0.67 +/- 0.28 PER MINUTE VS. 0.41 +/- 0.17 PER MINUTE) AND REPEATED HIGH-INTENSITY EFFORT (RHIE) BOUTS (1 EVERY 6.1 +/- 4.7 MINUTES VS. 1 EVERY 10.7 +/- 8.3 MINUTES) WERE ALSO HIGHER WHEN STOPPAGE TIME WAS EXCLUDED. LARGE NEGATIVE CORRELATIONS (P <= 0.001) WERE FOUND BETWEEN TOTAL BALL-IN-PLAY TIME AND RELATIVE MEASURES OF TOTAL DISTANCE (R = -0.67) AND LOW-SPEED ACTIVITY (R = -0.60). THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE GREATER MOVEMENT, CONTACT, AND RHIE DEMANDS WHEN RUGBY LEAGUE TIME-MOTION DATA ARE EXPRESSED RELATIVE TO BALL-IN-PLAY TIME. FURTHERMORE, THE REDUCTION IN RELATIVE INTENSITY WITH LONGER TOTAL BALL-IN-PLAY TIME SUGGESTS THAT DURING PROLONGED PASSAGES OF PLAY, PLAYERS ADOPT A PACING STRATEGY TO MAINTAIN HIGH-INTENSITY PERFORMANCE AND MANAGE FATIGUE."

ANTHROPOMETRY, PREDICTED ADULT STATURE, COUNTERMOVEMENT JUMP, 15-M SPRINT AND AGILITY TEST FROM 38 UNDER-11 YOUNG SOCCER PLAYERS WERE CONSIDERED. EARLY MATURING PLAYERS WERE 3\% TALLER COMPARED TO LATE MATURERS. A SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT OF AGE WAS PRESENT IN ALL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (P<0.05). PARAMETERS SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN PERFORMANCE, EVEN WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR INTERINDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN SOMATIC MATURITY. VERTICAL JUMP TENDED TO BE STABLE IN EARLY MATURERS DURING THE FIRST YEAR, PRESENTING AN EXPONENTIAL INCREASE THEREAFTER (16\%, P<0.05). ADDITIONALLY, EARLY MATURING BOYS HAD LOWER VERTICAL JUMP SCORES BUT A SUBSTANTIAL HIGHER RATE OF DEVELOPMENT WITH AGE (3\% PER YEAR). PERFORMANCE TENDS TO PLATEAU DURING THE FIRST 3 YEARS FOLLOWING THE IMPROVEMENTS IN AGILITY (9.1\%, P<0.05). IN THE RUNNING TESTS, EARLY MATURERS HAD BETTER PERFORMANCES (19\%, P<0.05), WHILE A HIGHER RATE OF IMPROVEMENT OF 1\% WAS OBSERVED FOR THE LATE MATURERS.

SPONSORSHIPS ARE EXPENSIVE AND CAN BE A SOURCE OF SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IF MANAGED APPROPRIATELY. THEREFORE, THE AUTHORS NEED TO APPROACH SPONSORSHIP STRATEGICALLY AND FORMALISE SPONSORSHIP DECISION-MAKING. SPONSORSHIPS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE COMPLEX, RELATIONSHIP-BASED, BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS SERVICES, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH SERVICES HAS BEEN ANALYSED IN THE NSD LITERATURE. AS PAST RESEARCH ON THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF SPONSORSHIP DEALS IS LIMITED, THE USE OF AN NSD PERSPECTIVE CAN HELP IN FORMALISING SPONSORSHIP DECISION-MAKING. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - FOUR CASE STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED INVOLVING TWO PROFESSIONAL, PREMIER LEAGUE FOOTBALL CLUBS AND TWO SPONSORING ORGANISATIONS, ONE MAJOR SPONSOR FOR EACH CLUB. ONE OF THE DYADS INVOLVED A BRAND NEW SPONSORSHIP DEAL AND THE OTHER A RENEWAL. FINDINGS - RESULTS SHOWED THAT IN BOTH DYADS, THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF THE NEW SERVICE FOLLOWS THE NSD PROCESS OF OTHER COMPLEX, RELATIONSHIP-BASED, BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS SERVICES AND INVOLVES THREE MAIN PHASES, NAMELY, INFORMATION COLLECTION, PROPOSAL PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION OR RECEIPT AND ANALYSIS, AND NEGOTIATIONS AND CONTRACT SIGN. ALL FOUR FIRMS USE A SEMI-FORMAL AND FLEXIBLE PROCESS, WHEREAS THE ACTORS IN EACH STAGE VARY. ALSO, THE NEW DEAL REQUIRES A MORE LENGTHY PROCESS THAN THE RENEWAL, FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF REALLY NEW AND ME-TOO SERVICES. MULTI-FUNCTIONAL TEAMS ARE NOT PRESENT, AND TOP MANAGEMENT INVOLVEMENT IS IMPORTANT ONLY IN THE LAST STAGE OF THE PROCESS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THIS PAPER HELPS IN ANALYSING THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF NEW SPONSORSHIP DEALS, AS NEW BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS SERVICES. HOWEVER, IT INVOLVES ONLY FOUR CASES AND HAS LIMITED GENERALISABILITY. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD SUBSTANTIATE RESULTS WITH MORE CASES OR QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - RESULTS CAN HELP SPONSORS AND SPONSEES TO STRUCTURE THEIR PROCESSES FOR SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SPONSORSHIP DEALS. ALSO, AS NEW SPONSORSHIP DEALS SEEM TO BE DEVELOPED THE SAME WAY WITH OTHER BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS, COMPLEX SERVICES, POTENTIAL SPONSORS THAT ARE BIG SERVICE PROVIDERS CAN PROBABLY ENJOY SYNERGIES FROM USING THE SAME OR A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PROCESS THAN THE ONE THEY USE FOR DEVELOPING THEIR MAIN SERVICES.

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - BY FOCUSSING ON THE DYNAMICS OF CLUB-STAKEHOLDER RELATIONSHIPS, THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK CAN BE SEEN AS AN ATTEMPT TO CLARIFY KEY FEATURES OF THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS SURROUNDING COACH DISMISSALS IN EUROPEAN PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL. FURTHERMORE, THE FRAMEWORK SUGGESTS THAT IN ORDER FOR A CLUB TO STAY ATTRACTIVE TO ITS STAKEHOLDERS, AND THEREBY INCREASE ITS CHANCES OF SECURING FUTURE FINANCIAL SUPPORT, CLUB DIRECTORS SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO THEIR EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - IN CONTRAST TO EXISTING RESEARCH, THIS STUDY DOES NOT AIM AT ASSESSING WHETHER A COACH DISMISSAL PAYS OFF IN TERMS OF WINS ON THE PITCH.

"STHER SA, 2015, SPORT BUS MANAG";"PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE TO WHAT DEGREE FOOTBALL CLUBS RECRUIT TALENTS AND GIVE THEM PLAYING TIME IN MATCHES. IT ALSO INVESTIGATES IF FOREIGN PLAYERS DISPLACE YOUNGER TALENTS. FURTHERMORE, IT ANALYSES TO WHAT DEGREE THE USE OF YOUNGER TALENTS AND FOREIGN PLAYERS INFLUENCE THE PERFORMANCES OF CLUBS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE EMPIRICAL DATA ARE FROM NORWEGIAN ELITE CLUBS, AND COME FROM TWO WEB SITES: WWW.ALTOMFOTBALL AND WWW. NETTAVISEN. NO. THE ANALYSES WERE DONE BY MEANS OF OLS-REGRESSIONS. FINDINGS - OLS-REGRESSIONS SHOWED THAT CLUBS THAT HAD MANY FOREIGN PLAYERS GAVE LESS PLAYING TIME TO U20 PLAYERS THAN OTHER CLUBS DID. HOWEVER, THESE CLUBS DID NOT HAVE FEWER YOUNGER TALENTS IN THE SQUAD THAN OTHER CLUBS DID. THIS INDICATES THAT FOREIGN PLAYERS REDUCE THE PLAYING TIME BEING GIVEN TO YOUNGER PLAYERS, BUT NOT THEIR ABILITY TO TRAIN WITH OTHER TEAMMATES. THE CLUBS THAT WON THE MOST POINTS GAVE LESS PLAYING TIME TO U20 PLAYERS (IN TERMS OF MINUTES). SURPRISINGLY, THE REGRESSION SHOWED THAT THE CLUBS THAT HAD MOST FOREIGN PLAYERS DID NOT WIN MORE POINTS THAN OTHERS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - NORWEGIAN FOOTBALL CLUBS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN, FOR EXAMPLE, CLUBS IN THE BIG EUROPEAN FOOTBALL NATIONS. THEREFORE, MORE RESEARCH IS NECESSARY TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE FINDINGS IN THIS RESEARCH CORRESPONDS WITH THE PATTERN IN OTHER NATIONS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - SO FAR, THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THESE ISSUES HAVE MAINLY BEEN BASED ON ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE AND VERY LITTLE ON THE FINDINGS IN ACADEMIC RESEARCH. THEREFORE, THIS RESEARCH GIVE NEW INSIGHT TO A FIELD THAT NEEDS MORE EMPIRICAL-BASED ANALYSES."
"PLUMLEY D, 2015, TEAM PERFORM MANAG";"PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE COMPETITIVE BALANCE OF THE UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE GROUP STAGES. THERE ARE NUMEROUS FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL BENEFITS TO CLUBS THAT PARTICIPATE IN THIS COMPETITION. THE CURRENT PAPER EXAMINES WHETHER THE SEEDING SYSTEM OPERATED BY UEFA IS HINDERING SOME LOWER RANKED TEAMS FROM QUALIFICATION AND, THUS, THE ASSOCIATED BENEFITS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - DATA WERE COLLECTED FOR ALL UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE GROUP STAGES BETWEEN1999/2000 AND 2013/2014. DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES INCLUDED HERFINDAHL-HIRSCHMAN INDEX TO EXAMINE COMPETITIVE BALANCE AND ONE-WAY ANOVAS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF THE CURRENT SEEDING SYSTEM ON CLUB PERFORMANCE. FINDINGS - THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE FLAWS IN THE RANKING AND SEEDING SYSTEM USED BY UEFA, AS RESULTS SHOW THAT THE COMPETITION IS COMPETITIVELY IMBALANCED AT THE GROUP STAGE. ADDITIONALLY, CLUBS THAT ARE CONTINUALLY PLACED IN THE HIGHEST SEEDING POT HISTORICALLY TEND TO ACCUMULATE MORE POINTS AND FINISH IN A HIGHER POSITION IN THE GROUP, THEREBY GIVING THEM A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO PROGRESS FURTHER IN THE COMPETITION. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE STUDY HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR BOTH THE CLUBS COMPETING IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE, WHO WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE SEEDING SYSTEM, AND UEFA THEMSELVES WHEN CONSIDERING THE SPORTING INTEGRITY OF THEIR FLAGSHIP COMPETITION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - TO THE AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST PAPER OF ITS KIND TO EXAMINE COMPETITIVE BALANCE IN THIS COMPETITION, AND THE PAPER CONTRIBUTES NEW KNOWLEDGE THAT EXTENDS THE RESEARCH UNDERTAKEN IN THE FIELD PREVIOUSLY."

"DRAYER J, 2014, EUR SPORT MANAG Q";"RESEARCH QUESTION: THE SECONDARY TICKET MARKET HAS TRADITIONALLY LACKED THE PERCEPTION THAT IT WAS A SAFE AND LEGITIMATE PLACE TO ACQUIRE TICKETS. THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEGITIMACY-BUILDING STRATEGIES, SUCH AS LOBBYING FOR THE DEREGULATION OF ANTI-TICKET-SCALPING LAWS AND ENGAGING IN PARTNERSHIPS WITH ESTABLISHED SPORT ORGANIZATIONS, AND THE REVENUES GENERATED BY THE LARGEST SECONDARY MARKET FIRM, STUBHUB. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE (NFL) TICKET RESALE. RESEARCH METHODS: STUBHUB PROVIDED TICKET RESALE FIGURES FOR ALL 256 REGULAR SEASON GAMES WHICH TOOK PLACE DURING THE 2007 NFL SEASON. HIERARCHICAL REGRESSION WAS UTILIZED IN ORDER TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BOTH PRICE RESTRICTIONS AND SECONDARY MARKET PARTNERSHIPS, AND TICKET RESALE PRICE AND TICKET RESALE VOLUME. RESULTS AND FINDINGS: RESULTS INDICATE SECONDARY MARKET PARTNERSHIPS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON FIRM REVENUES, INCREASING THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS WHILE ACCOUNTING FOR ONLY SLIGHT DECREASES IN PRICE. ANTI-SCALPING LAWS HAVE A LESS PRONOUNCED ASSOCIATION WITH RESALE VOLUME AND PRICE. IMPLICATIONS: THIS RESEARCH EXTENDS ACADEMIC LITERATURE ON SECONDARY MARKET OPERATIONS AND PROVIDES PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS AS PRIMARY AND SECONDARY MARKET FIRMS AS WELL AS STATE AND LOCAL LEGISLATURES MAY USE THE FINDINGS TO INFORM THEIR DECISION-MAKING."
"MCDONALD H, 2014, EUR SPORT MANAG Q";"RESEARCH QUESTION: A MAJOR BARRIER TO RETAINING EXISTING CUSTOMERS IS THE DIFFICULTY IN KNOWING WHO IS MOST AT RISK OF LEAVING (OR `CHURNING'). GIVEN THE STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL IMPORTANCE OF SEASON TICKET HOLDERS (STH) TO PROFESSIONAL SPORT TEAMS, THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A RANGE OF VARIABLES IN IDENTIFYING THE STH WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO CHURN. RESEARCH METHODS: A LONGITUDINAL FIELD STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO REFLECT ACTUAL CONDITIONS. SURVEY DATA OF A PROFESSIONAL SPORT TEAM STH WERE COLLECTED PRIOR TO THE CONCLUSION OF THE SEASON. ACTUAL RENEWAL DATA WERE THEN TRACKED FROM TEAM RECORDS THE FOLLOWING SEASON. THIS WORK WAS REPLICATED ACROSS FIVE PROFESSIONAL SPORT TEAMS FROM THE AUSTRALIAN FOOTBALL LEAGUE, WITH RENEWAL PREDICTIONS MADE AND TRACKED FOR OVER 10,000 STH. RESULTS AND FINDINGS: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE `JUSTER' SCALE - A SIMPLE, ONE-ITEM PURCHASE PROBABILITY MEASURE - IS AN EFFECTIVE IDENTIFIER OF THOSE MOST AT RISK OF CHURNING, MORE THAN 3 MONTHS IN ADVANCE. WHEN COMBINED WITH TICKET UTILIZATION AND TENURE MEASURES, PREDICTIVE ACCURACY IMPROVES MARKEDLY, TO THE POINT WHERE THESE THREE MEASURES CAN BE USED TO PROVIDE AN EFFECTIVE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM FOR MANAGERS. IMPLICATIONS: WHILST THERE IS A TENDENCY TO VIEW STH AS HIGHLY LOYAL, THESE DATA REINFORCE THE IMPORTANCE OF ACTIVELY MANAGING ALL CUSTOMERS TO REDUCE CHURN. DESPITE THEIR COMMITMENT, STH DO CHURN, BUT THOSE MOST LIKELY TO CAN BE PREDICTED BY EXAMINING THEIR PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOUR IN THE CURRENT SEASON. EFFORTS TO RETAIN STH NEED TO SHIFT THEIR FOCUS FROM TRANSACTIONAL VALUE ASSESSMENTS."

"CONSTANTINOU AC, 2014, PSYCHOL SPORT EXERC";"OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS REFEREE BIAS WITH RESPECT TO FOULS AND PENALTY KICKS AWARDED BY TAKING EXPLANATORY FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION. DESIGN: WE PRESENT A NOVEL BAYESIAN NETWORK MODEL FOR ASSESSING REFEREE BIAS WITH RESPECT TO FOULS AND PENALTY KICKS AWARDED. THE MODEL IS APPLIED TO THE 2011-12 ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE SEASON. METHOD: UNLIKE PREVIOUS STUDIES, THE MODEL TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION EXPLANATORY FACTORS WHICH, IF IGNORED, CAN LEAD TO BIASED ASSESSMENTS OF REFEREE BIAS. FOR EXAMPLE, A TEAM MAY BE AWARDED MORE PENALTIES SIMPLY BECAUSE IT ATTACKS MORE, NOT BECAUSE REFEREES ARE BIASED IN ITS FAVOUR. HENCE, WE INCORPORATE CAUSAL FACTORS SUCH AS POSSESSION, TIME SPENT IN THE OPPOSITION PENALTY BOX, ETC. PRIOR TO ESTIMATING THE DEGREE OF PENALTY KICKS BIAS. RESULTS: WE FOUND FAIRLY STRONG REFEREE BIAS, BASED ON PENALTY KICKS AWARDED, IN FAVOUR OF CERTAIN TEAMS WHEN PLAYING AT HOME. SPECIFICALLY, THE TWO TEAMS (MANCHESTER CITY AND MANCHESTER UNITED) WHO FINISHED FIRST AND SECOND APPEAR TO HAVE BENEFITED FROM BIAS THAT CANNOT BE FULLY JUSTIFIED BY THE EXPLANATORY FACTORS. CONVERSELY ARSENAL, A TEAM OF SIMILAR POPULARITY AND WEALTH AND WHO FINISHED THIRD, BENEFITED LEAST OF ALL 20 TEAMS FROM REFEREE BIAS AT HOME WITH RESPECT TO PENALTY KICKS AWARDED. CONCLUSIONS: AMONG OUR CONCLUSIONS ARE THAT, IN CONTRAST TO MANY PREVIOUS STUDIES, BEING THE HOME TEAM DOES NOT IN ITSELF RESULT IN POSITIVE REFEREE BIAS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE MODEL IS ABLE TO EXPLAIN SIGNIFICANT DISCREPANCIES OF PENALTY KICKS BIAS INTO NON-SIGNIFICANT AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR THE EXPLANATORY FACTORS. (C) 2014 ELSEVIER LTD.

SIXTY-EIGHT BOYS (11.0 +/- 1.1 YEARS) AND 45 GIRLS (11.3 +/- 0.9 YEARS) PERFORMED A VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL JUMP, 30-M SPRINT, AND CHANGE OF DIRECTION (COD) TIME TRIAL. AFTER ALLOMETRIC ANALYSIS, A COMMON SEX SCALING FACTOR OF BODY MASS WAS USED FOR VERTICAL (B = 1.02) AND HORIZONTAL (B = 0.97) POWER. NO SIGNIFICANT SEX DIFFERENCE IN RELATIVE LEG POWER WAS FOUND BEFORE AND AFTER CONTROLLING FOR MATURITY STATUS. GENDER DIFFERENCES IN 10 M, THE ZIGZAG SECTION, AND FLYING 10 M OF THE COD TASK WERE FOUND SIGNIFICANT ONCE ADJUSTED FOR MATURITY (P <= 0.05). HOWEVER, BOYS PERFORMED BETTER THAN GIRLS IN 20- AND 30-M SPRINT AND THE COD TIME TRIAL REGARDLESS OF MATURITY STATUS (P <= 0.05). REDUCED ENDOMORPHY IN BOYS WAS THE BEST PREDICTOR OF EXPLOSIVE ACTIONS (R-2 = 7-22\%), WHEREAS FEMALE PERFORMANCE WAS BEST EXPLAINED BY MASS AND MATURITY STATUS (R-2 = 15-19\%). JUMP POWER-SPECIFIC ALLOMETRIC SCALING FACTORS NEED TO BE DETERMINED TO ACCOUNT FOR BODY SIZE. A TRAINING EMPHASIS ON SPRINTING AND COD AT A YOUNGER AGE IN GIRLS COMPARED WITH BOYS IS RECOMMENDED BECAUSE OF THEIR EARLIER ONSET OF PUBERTY AND REDUCED NATURAL ABILITY IN THESE TASKS. SOMATOTYPE, AGE, MATURITY, AND BODY MASS SHOULD BE MONITORED DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUTH ATHLETES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND EXPLOSIVE PERFORMANCE."

"QUEEN RM, 2014, J ATHL TRAIN";"CONTEXT: STRESS FRACTURES ARE ONE OF THE MOST COMMON INJURIES IN SPORTS, ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY 10\% OF ALL OVERUSE INJURIES. TREATMENT OF FIFTH METATARSAL STRESS FRACTURES INVOLVES BOTH SURGICAL AND NONSURGICAL INTERVENTIONS. FIFTH METATARSAL STRESS FRACTURES ARE DIFFICULT TO TREAT BECAUSE OF THE RISKS OF DELAYED UNION, NONUNION, AND RECURRENT INJURIES. MOST OF THESE INJURIES OCCUR DURING AGILITY TASKS, SUCH AS THOSE PERFORMED IN SOCCER, BASKETBALL, AND LACROSSE. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF A RIGID CARBON GRAPHITE FOOTPLATE ON PLANTAR LOADING DURING 2 AGILITY TASKS. DESIGN: CROSSOVER STUDY. SETTING: LABORATORY. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A TOTAL OF 19 RECREATIONAL MALE ATHLETES WITH NO HISTORY OF LOWER EXTREMITY INJURY IN THE PAST 6 MONTHS AND NO PREVIOUS METATARSAL STRESS FRACTURES WERE TESTED. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): SEVEN 458 SIDE-CUT AND CROSS-OVER-CUT TASKS WERE COMPLETED IN A SHOE WITH OR WITHOUT A FULL-LENGTH RIGID CARBON PLATE. TESTING ORDER BETWEEN THE SHOE CONDITIONS AND THE 2 CUTTING TASKS WAS RANDOMIZED. PLANTAR-LOADING DATA WERE RECORDED USING INSTRUMENTED INSOLES. PEAK PRESSURE, MAXIMUM FORCE, FORCE-TIME INTEGRAL, AND CONTACT AREA BENEATH THE TOTAL FOOT, THE MEDIAL AND LATERAL MIDFOOT, AND THE MEDIAL, MIDDLE, AND LATERAL FOREFOOT WERE ANALYZED. A SERIES OF PAIRED T TESTS WAS USED TO EXAMINE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FOOTWEAR CONDITIONS (CARBON GRAPHITE FOOTPLATE, SHOD) FOR BOTH CUTTING TASKS INDEPENDENTLY (A = .05). RESULTS: DURING THE SIDE-CUT TASK, THE FOOTPLATE INCREASED TOTAL FOOT AND LATERAL MIDFOOT PEAK PRESSURES WHILE DECREASING CONTACT AREA AND LATERAL MIDFOOT FORCE-TIME INTEGRAL. DURING THE CROSSOVER-CUT TASK, THE FOOTPLATE INCREASED TOTAL FOOT AND LATERAL MIDFOOT PEAK PRESSURE AND LATERAL FOREFOOT FORCE-TIME INTEGRAL WHILE DECREASING TOTAL AND LATERAL FOREFOOT CONTACT AREA. CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH A RIGID CARBON GRAPHITE FOOTPLATE ALTERED SOME ASPECTS OF THE PLANTAR-PRESSURE PROFILE DURING CUTTING IN UNINJURED PARTICIPANTS, IT WAS INEFFECTIVE IN REDUCING PLANTAR LOADING BENEATH THE FIFTH METATARSAL."

AT ITS VERY HEART, AGILITY ALLOWS INTEGRATING DIVERGING STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, I.E. FOCUS AND ADAPTABILITY, COMMITMENT AND FLEXIBILITY. THIS PAPER AIMS AT PROVIDING NEW EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS THE STRATEGIC AGILITY MODEL AND FOCUSES ON A CASE WHICH FITS THE VARIOUS DIMENSIONS DESCRIBED BY DOZ AND KOSONEN. SPECIFICALLY, OUR STUDY REFERS TO THE CONTEXT OF SOCCER, WHERE PROFESSIONAL TEAMS STRUGGLE TO BALANCE DIVERGENT STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, I.E. TO ACHIEVE BOTH GOOD SPORTS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCES. WE ARGUE INDEED THAT THESE OBJECTIVES CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY BALANCED OVER TIME THROUGH STRATEGIC AGILITY. THE CASE WE USE TO SUPPORT THIS HYPOTHESIS IS THAT OF UDINESE CALCIO S.P.A., AN ITALIAN SOCCER TEAM WHICH IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS HAS ADOPTED A BUSINESS MODEL BASED ON STRONG INVESTMENTS AND QUICK TURNAROUND OF YOUNG AND PROMISING PLAYERS, WHICH HAS TURNED IT INTO A FACTORY OF TALENTS. UDINESE CALCIO HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO SO KEEPING ITS BOOKS IN ORDER AND AT THE SAME TIME MANAGING TO OBTAIN EXCELLENT RESULTS IN A VERY COMPETITIVE NATIONAL SOCCER TOURNAMENT SUCH AS THE ITALIAN SERIE A. UDINESE IS A SMALL ORGANIZATION BASED IN A MEDIUM-SIZED CITY IN THE NORTH-EAST OF ITALY, AN AREA WHICH IS INDEED PERIPHERAL FROM A GEOPOLITICAL AND BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE. THE TEAM CAN COUNT ON LIMITED RESOURCES, IT IS NOT OWNED BY WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS WITH LOW SPENDING CONSTRAINTS AND AN EMOTIONAL ATTITUDE, AND IT IS A QUITE UNIQUE CASE FOR BOTH ITS SPORTS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCES. THESE RESULTS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED, DESPITE THE UNIQUE BUSINESS MODEL WHICH RELIES ON YOUNG TALENTS MORE THAN ON WELL-KNOWN, EXPERIENCED PLAYERS, THROUGH EXCELLENT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT HAVE MADE UDINESE CALCIO A STRATEGICALLY AGILE ORGANIZATION.

"WILSON RS, 2014, J EXP BIOL";"WHY ARE PERFORMANCE TRADE-OFFS SO RARELY DETECTED IN ANIMALS WHEN THEIR UNDERLYING PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS SEEMS SO INTUITIVE? ONE POSSIBILITY IS THAT INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN HEALTH, FITNESS, NUTRITION, DEVELOPMENT OR GENETICS, OR `INDIVIDUAL QUALITY', MAKES SOME INDIVIDUALS BETTER OR WORSE PERFORMERS ACROSS ALL MOTOR TASKS. IF THIS IS THE CASE, THEN CORRECTING FOR INDIVIDUAL QUALITY SHOULD REVEAL FUNCTIONAL TRADE-OFFS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE OVERLOOKED. WE TESTED THIS IDEA BY EXPLORING TRADE-OFFS IN MAXIMUM PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE AND MOTOR SKILL FUNCTION IN SEMIPROFESSIONAL SOCCER PLAYERS. WE ASSESSED INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE ACROSS FIVE MAXIMUM `ATHLETIC' TASKS PROVIDING INDEPENDENT MEASURES OF POWER, STAMINA AND SPEED, AS WELL AS FIVE SOCCER-SPECIFIC `MOTOR SKILL' TASKS PROVIDING INDEPENDENT MEASURES OF FOOT CONTROL. WE EXPECTED TO FIND FUNCTIONAL TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN PAIRS OF TRAITS (E. G. ENDURANCE VERSUS POWER/SPEED TASKS OR SPECIALIST-GENERALIST PERFORMANCE) - BUT ONLY AFTER CORRECTING FOR INDIVIDUAL QUALITY. ANALYSES OF STANDARDISED RAW DATA FOUND POSITIVE ASSOCIATIONS AMONG SEVERAL PAIRS OF TRAITS, BUT NO EVIDENCE OF PERFORMANCE TRADE-OFFS. INDEED, PEAK PERFORMANCE ACROSS A SINGLE ATHLETIC TASK (DEGREE OF SPECIALISATION) WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH PERFORMANCE AVERAGED ACROSS ALL OTHER ATHLETIC TASKS (GENERALIST). HOWEVER, AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR AN INDIVIDUAL'S OVERALL QUALITY, SEVERAL FUNCTIONAL TRADE-OFFS BECAME EVIDENT. WITHIN OUR QUALITY-CORRECTED DATA, 1500 M-SPEED (ENDURANCE) WAS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH SQUAT TIME (POWER), JUMP DISTANCE (POWER) AND AGILITY SPEED REFLECTING THE EXPECTED SPEED-ENDURANCE TRADE-OFF; AND DEGREE OF SPECIALISATION WAS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH AVERAGE PERFORMANCE ACROSS TASKS. TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR DATA SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN GENERAL QUALITY CAN MASK THE DETECTION OF PERFORMANCE TRADE-OFFS AT THE WHOLE-ANIMAL LEVEL.

THIS STUDY ALSO EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF PERCEIVED OPPONENTS' SKILL AND PERCEIVED WINNING EXPECTATIONS ON THE DESIRE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ADVERTISED FANTASY SPORTS SERVICE. FINDINGS INDICATED THAT ENTRY FEE AND REWARD INFORMATION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE PARTICIPANTS' EXPECTATION OF OPPONENT QUALITY, BUT THAT THIS EXPECTATION DID NOT RESULT IN DECREASES IN THE SUBJECTS' SELF-REPORTED PROBABILITY OF WINNING THE LEAGUE.

EMPIRICAL TAXONOMY WITH WARD'S HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING TECHNIQUE BASED ON THE VARIABLES ACQUIRED FROM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF ALL 6,130 SPORTS NGOS IN SLOVENIA WAS USED TO CLUSTER ORGANISATIONS INTO THREE FINANCIAL DESIGN TYPES: GRASSROOTS SPORTS ORGANISATIONS, SEMI-PROFESSIONAL SPORTS NGOS, AND PROFESSIONAL SPORTS NGOS. CLUSTERS VARIED IN MAGNITUDE AND STRUCTURE OF FINANCIAL ITEMS. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE BUSINESS OF GRASSROOTS SPORTS ORGANISATIONS IS VERY SIMPLE, WHILE WITH SEMI-PROFESSIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL SPORTS NGOS IT IS MORE COMPLEX, AND CONSEQUENTLY SUCH ORGANISATIONS ARE CONFRONTED WITH CASH FLOW AND EVEN SOLVENCY PROBLEMS. TOTAL AVERAGE REVENUES OF GRASSROOTS SPORTS ORGANISATIONS ((SIC)6,304) ARE APPROXIMATELY ONE TENTH THE SIZE OF THE SEMI-PROFESSIONAL SPORTS NGOS AND 192 TIMES SMALLER THAN PROFESSIONAL SPORTS NGOS. AS FOR THE STRUCTURE OF REVENUES, PROFESSIONAL SPORTS NGOS HAVE A LARGER PROPORTION OF SALES REVENUES AND MUCH LOWER MEMBERSHIP FEES, DONATIONS, AND OTHER REVENUES. SEMIPROFESSIONAL SPORTS NGOS DIFFER FROM GRASSROOTS SPORT IN A SLIGHTLY HIGHER PROPORTION OF SALES REVENUES AND DONATIONS. AS REGARDS THE STRUCTURE OF EXPENSES, PROFESSIONAL SPORTS NGOS HAD A 5.6 TIMES HIGHER PROPORTION OF LABOUR COSTS IN COMPARISON WITH GRASSROOTS SPORTS AND 1.4 TIMES HIGHER COMPARED TO SEMI-PROFESSIONAL SPORTS NGOS. SUCH A TAXONOMY COULD PRESENT AN APPROPRIATE BASIS FOR INVESTIGATING THE TRUE DIMENSION OF THE IMPACT OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS ON SPORTS NGOS IN A SMALL EUROPEAN SPORTS ECONOMY."
"ELLIOTT R, 2013, INT REV SOCIOL SPORT";"THE INTENTION OF THIS PAPER IS TO OFFER A PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THE MIGRATIONS OF PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLERS TO POLAND'S TOP DIVISION - THE EKSTRAKLASA. BASED UPON A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED WITH MIGRANT PLAYERS LOCATED AT AN EKSTRAKLASA CLUB, THE PAPER FOCUSES SPECIFICALLY ON THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE PLAYERS' DECISIONS TO MIGRATE TO THAT PARTICULAR LEAGUE. THE PAPER IDENTIFIES THAT WHILST THE EKSTRAKLASA MIGHT SIT OUTSIDE OF EUROPE'S CORE FOOTBALL ECONOMIES, IT STILL OFFERS MUCH AS A MIGRATION DESTINATION FOR CERTAIN SORTS OF PLAYERS. SPECIFICALLY, THE PAPER SHOWS HOW PULL' FACTORS, SUCH AS FINANCIAL GAIN AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY IN EUROPE'S ELITE CLUB COMPETITIONS, ARE JUXTAPOSED WITH A NUMBER OF STRUCTURAL FACTORS THAT PUSH' MIGRANTS FROM PARTICULAR LOCATIONS AND THAT ARE CONTOURED BY THE PLAYERS' DESIRES TO PROGRESS IN THEIR CAREERS. THE PAPER CONCLUDES BY SHOWING THAT THE MOTIVATIONS OF THE MIGRANTS CANNOT BE REDUCED TO ANY SINGLE CAUSAL FACTOR, BUT RATHER, TO BE MORE MEANINGFUL, A SERIES OF INTERDEPENDENT PROCESSES SHOULD BE SEEN TO BE AT WORK."
"DARBY P, 2013, GEOFORUM";"THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE PRODUCTION AND TRANSNATIONAL EXPORT OF GHANAIAN FOOTBALL LABOUR. IT DOES SO VIA A CROSS-DISCIPLINARY APPROACH THAT UTILISES PERSPECTIVES ROOTED IN THE SOCIOLOGY OF DEVELOPMENT (GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS) AND ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY (GLOBAL PRODUCTION NETWORKS). THE ARTICLE IS UNDERPINNED BY TWO CENTRAL ARGUMENTS. FIRSTLY, IT CONTENDS THAT THE GVC FRAMEWORK IS USEFUL IN ACCOUNTING FOR HOW GHANAIAN PLAYERS ARE PRODUCED AND PREPARED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET, IDENTIFYING THE KEY AGENTS AND AGENCIES INVOLVED, MAPPING THE GEOGRAPHY OF PRODUCTION AND EXPORT AND ASSESSING THE INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT WITHIN WHICH THE TRADE OPERATES LOCALLY, NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. THE SECOND DRAWS ON THE GPN PERSPECTIVE TO ARGUE THAT WHILE GHANAIAN FOOTBALL LABOUR MIGRATION REMAINS A PROCESS CONTOURED BY UNEVEN ASYMMETRIES OF POWER THAT FAVOUR ACTORS, STAKEHOLDERS AND ENTITIES IN THE GLOBAL NORTH, THERE ARE CURRENTLY SEGMENTS OF THE PRODUCTION-EXPORT CHAIN WHERE POWER IS MUCH MORE DIFFUSE AND SOME BENEFITS ARE CAPTURED IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH.

"ROACH MA, 2013, APPL ECON LETT";"JUST AS FIRMS MUST CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT, SPORTS TEAMS MUST CONSIDER WHETHER A COACHING CHANGE WILL IMPROVE THE TEAM'S ON-FIELD PERFORMANCE. I EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF COACHING CHANGES FOR NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE (NFL) TEAMS BETWEEN THE 1995 AND 2012 SEASONS. A VARIETY OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO AN NFL TEAM'S PERFORMANCE REVERTING TOWARDS LEAGUE-AVERAGE LEVELS BETWEEN SEASONS. THUS, A NOMINAL IMPROVEMENT IN TEAM PERFORMANCE COULD BE DUE TO IMPROVED MANAGEMENT OR IT COULD SIMPLY BE MEAN REVERSION. I FIND THAT, AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR THE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT MEAN REVERSION EFFECT DURING THIS TIME PERIOD, FIRING A COACH REDUCES A TEAM'S EXPECTED PERFORMANCE DURING THE NEXT SEASON AND THE TEAM'S AVERAGE PERFORMANCE OVER THE NEXT TWO SEASONS. THIS EFFECT IS PRESENT WHEN WINS ARE USED TO MEASURE PERFORMANCE, BUT ALSO WHEN PERFORMANCE IS MEASURED BY POINT DIFFERENTIAL AND PLAYOFF APPEARANCES, TWO VARIABLES THAT AVOID SOME SHORTCOMINGS OF USING TEAM WINS AS A MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE. I CONCLUDE THAT TEAMS ARE FIRING COACHES AN INEFFICIENTLY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THE TIME."
"SCHIPILOW JD, 2013, BONE";"ATHLETES PARTICIPATING IN SPORTS CHARACTERIZED BY SPECIFIC LOADING MODALITIES HAVE EXHIBITED DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AUGMENTATION OF BONE PROPERTIES; HOWEVER, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE LOADING ENVIRONMENTS AFFECT BONE MICRO-ARCHITECTURE AND ESTIMATED BONE STRENGTH (I.E. BONE QUALITY) REMAINS UNCLEAR. FURTHERMORE, THE RELATIVE ROLE OF IMPACT LOADING VERSUS LOADING DUE TO MUSCLE FORCES IN DETERMINING BONE PROPERTIES IS CONFOUNDED. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY WERE 1) TO EXAMINE THE ROLE OF IMPACT LOADING ON BONE QUALITY OF THE DISTAL RADIUS AND DISTAL TIBIA IN ELITE ATHLETES, AS DETERMINED BY HIGH RESOLUTION PERIPHERAL QUANTITATIVE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (HR-PQCT) AND FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS (FEA), AND 2) TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BONE QUALITY AND MUSCLE STRENGTH IN ELITE ATHLETES. NINETY-FIVE FEMALES (N = 59) AND MALES (N = 36) BETWEEN THE AGES OF 16-30 YEARS PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED ALPINE SKIERS (HIGH-IMPACT), SOCCER PLAYERS (MODERATE IMPACT), SWIMMERS (LOW-IMPACT), AND NON-ATHLETIC CONTROLS. ALL GROUP COMPARISONS WERE MADE AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR AGE, HEIGHT, AND BODY MASS. AS EXPECTED, MINIMAL DIFFERENCES IN HR-PQCT PARAMETERS ACROSS GROUPS WERE OBSERVED AT THE NON WEIGHT-BEARING DISTAL RADIUS. AT THE WEIGHT-BEARING DISTAL TIBIA, FEMALE ALPINE SKIERS AND SOCCER PLAYERS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BONE DENSITY, CORTICAL THICKNESS, AND FAILURE LOAD (I.E. BONE STRENGTH (N) IN COMPRESSION ESTIMATED BY FEA) THAN SWIMMERS (P < 0.05). FEMALE ALPINE SKIERS ALSO HAD LOWER TRABECULAR SEPARATION THAN SWIMMERS AND CONTROLS. MALE ALPINE SKIERS HAD 20\% HIGHER TRABECULAR BONE MINERAL DENSITY THAN SWIMMERS, AND MALE SOCCER PLAYERS EXHIBITED 22\% HIGHER TRABECULAR NUMBER THAN SWIMMERS AT THE DISTAL TIBIA (P < 0.05). MALE ALPINE SKIERS AND SOCCER PLAYERS HAD 28-38\% HIGHER FAILURE LOAD AT THE DISTAL TIBIA THAN SWIMMERS. NO DIFFERENCES IN BONE PARAMETERS WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN SWIMMERS AND CONTROLS FOR EITHER SEX AT EITHER SITE. BOTH MUSCLE STRENGTH AND SPORTING ACTIVITY WERE PREDICTORS OF FAILURE LOAD AT THE DISTAL TIBIA IN THE FEMALE COHORT. SPORTING ACTIVITY, BUT NOT MUSCLE STRENGTH, WAS A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF FAILURE LOAD IN THE MALE COHORT AT BOTH THE RADIUS AND TIBIA. THIS DATA SUGGESTS THAT IMPACT LOADING IN SPORTING ACTIVITY IS HIGHLY ASSOCIATED WITH BONE QUALITY. LONGITUDINAL AND INTERVENTIONAL STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO FURTHER CLARIFY THE MUSCLE-BONE INTERACTION. (C) 2013 THE AUTHORS. PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED."
"BINGHAM T, 2013, VOLUNTAS";"THE CHANGE IN POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IN THE UK IN 2010 HAS CREATED FINANCIAL UNCERTAINTY AND INSTABILITY FOR MANY THIRD SECTOR ORGANISATIONS. IN A SHIFTING FUNDING LANDSCAPE, IT IS CLEAR THAT AN OVER-RELIANCE ON GOVERNMENT FUNDING IS A RISKY STRATEGY AND THAT THERE IS A NEED TO DIVERSIFY AND SEEK OUT ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF REVENUE. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE IMPACT OF POLITICAL CHANGE ON THE FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY OF COMMUNITY SPORTS TRUSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PREMIER LEAGUE AND FOOTBALL LEAGUE CLUBS IN ENGLAND. IT EXPLORES SOURCES OF REVENUE THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, REVEALING THAT ON AVERAGE COMMUNITY SPORTS TRUSTS RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF INCOME FROM GRANT FUNDING WHILST SPONSORSHIP INCOME IS RELATIVELY SMALL. THE ARTICLE GOES ON TO DISCUSS THE POTENTIAL FOR COMMUNITY SPORTS TRUSTS TO DIVERSIFY REVENUE STREAMS BY DEVELOPING SOCIAL PARTNERSHIPS THAT ADDRESS THE CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) AGENDAS OF COMMERCIAL ORGANISATIONS. IT ILLUSTRATES THAT ALTHOUGH COMMERCIAL SPONSORSHIP CAN PROVIDE BENEFITS INCLUDING THE PROVISION OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT CAN ENABLE FINANCIAL STABILITY, KEY ISSUES INCLUDE THE BALANCE OF POWER, THE IMPACT ON ORGANISATIONAL FLEXIBILITY, WHETHER THERE IS A NEED TO RESTRUCTURE, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF LONG-TERM PARTNERSHIPS. ALTHOUGH THE FINDINGS FROM THIS ARTICLE ARE FOCUSED ON A PARTICULAR TYPE OF CHARITY, GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF CSR PARTNERSHIP INCOME FOR THE CHARITIES SECTOR THEY MAY ALSO HAVE BROADER IMPLICATIONS FOR OTHER CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS."
"HUNT KJ, 2013, CLIN J SPORT MED";"OBJECTIVE: TO DESCRIBE THE INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS FOR HIGH ANKLE SPRAINS (IE, SYNDESMOSIS INJURIES) AMONG NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION (NCAA) FOOTBALL PLAYERS. DESIGN: DESCRIPTIVE EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDY. SETTING: DATA WERE EXAMINED FROM THE NCAA'S INJURY SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (ISS) FOR 5 FOOTBALL SEASONS (FROM 2004-2005 TO 2008-2009). PARTICIPANTS: ALL NCAA MEN'S FOOTBALL PROGRAMS PARTICIPATING IN THE ISS. ASSESSMENT OF RISK FACTORS: NO ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS WERE INTRODUCED AS A RESULT OF THIS ANALYSIS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: FOR PARTIAL AND COMPLETE SYNDESMOSIS INJURIES, OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED INCIDENCE, TIME LOST FROM PARTICIPATION, AND REQUIREMENT FOR SURGICAL REPAIR. RESULTS: THE OVERALL INCIDENCE OF HIGH ANKLE SPRAINS IN NCAA FOOTBALL PLAYERS WAS 0.24 PER 1000 ATHLETE EXPOSURES, ACCOUNTING FOR 24.6\% OF ALL ANKLE SPRAINS. ATHLETES WERE NEARLY 14 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO SUSTAIN THE INJURY DURING GAMES COMPARED WITH PRACTICE; COMPLETE SYNDESMOSIS INJURIES RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER TIME LOST COMPARED WITH PARTIAL INJURIES (31.3 VS 15.8 DAYS). LESS THAN 3\% OF SYNDESMOSIS INJURIES REQUIRED SURGICAL INTERVENTION. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER INJURY INCIDENCE ON ARTIFICIAL SURFACES COMPARED WITH NATURAL GRASS. THE MAJORITY OF INJURIES (75.2\%) OCCURRED DURING CONTACT WITH ANOTHER PLAYER. CONCLUSIONS: OUR DATA SUGGEST A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER INCIDENCE OF SYNDESMOSIS INJURIES DURING GAMES, DURING RUNNING PLAYS, AND TO RUNNING BACKS AND INTERIOR DEFENSIVE LINEMEN. THE WIDE RANGE IN TIME LOST FROM PARTICIPATION FOR COMPLETE SYNDESMOSIS INJURIES UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF INJURY MECHANISM AND CLASSIFICATION OF INJURY SEVERITY SUCH THAT PREVENTION, SAFE RETURN TO PLAY PROTOCOLS, AND OUTCOMES CAN BE FURTHER IMPROVED."
"CORDERY CJ, 2013, SPORT MANAG REV";"FINANCIAL VULNERABILITY IS A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR NONPROFIT SPORTS CLUBS DUE TO CLUBS' INCREASING COSTS AND IMPEDIMENTS TO GENERATING SUFFICIENT INCOME. THE FIRST OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DERIVE A CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF FINANCIAL VULNERABILITY FOR SPORTS CLUBS BY ASSESSING THREE FINANCIAL VULNERABILITY MODELS, TWO OF WHICH HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN APPLIED IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR GENERALLY. TWO MODELS ARE BASED ON REVENUE PATTERNS AND EXPENDITURE, AND THE THIRD IS BASED ON MOVEMENTS IN NET ASSETS OVER FOUR YEARS. A SECOND OBJECTIVE IS TO IDENTIFY DETERMINANTS OF FINANCIAL VULNERABILITY WITHIN AMATEUR SPORTS CLUBS, FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON GOLF AND FOOTBALL. THE DATA TO TEST THESE MODELS WERE DERIVED FROM THE FINANCIAL REPORTS OF 227 AMATEUR SPORTS CLUBS IN NEW ZEALAND (98 FOOTBALL AND 129 GOLF CLUBS). EACH OF THE THREE MODELS RESULTS IN DIFFERENT PREDICTIVE VARIABLES AND HAS DIFFERENT EXPLANATORY STRENGTHS. FOR EXAMPLE, FOOTBALL CLUBS THAT WERE FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE UNDER MODEL 1: PROGRAM EXPENDITURE HAD DECLINING REVENUES FROM MEMBERS AND TRADING, AS WELL AS HIGH ADMINISTRATION COSTS. CONVERSELY, DECLINING RESERVES ARE PREDICTIVE IN FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE GOLF CLUBS USING MODEL 2: NET ASSETS. MODEL 3: NET EARNINGS WAS GENERALIZABLE TO BOTH FOOTBALL AND GOLF CLUBS. THE EXPLANATORY VARIABLES WERE DIFFERENT BETWEEN THESE SPORTS, DUE TO THEIR DIFFERENT ASSET BASE AND PROPENSITY TO EMPLOY PAID STAFF. THE COMMON VARIABLES THOSE WITH OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES SHOULD MONITOR AGAINST FINANCIAL VULNERABILITY ARE: AN UNDUE RELIANCE ON EXTERNAL, RATHER THAN MEMBER-BASED REVENUE, INCREASING DEBT, AND EXCESSIVE EXPENDITURE. FURTHER RESEARCH COULD EXTEND THIS MODEL TO OTHER SPORTS AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS. (C) 2012 SPORT MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND. PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED."

PEOPLE CHOOSE RISKIER INVESTMENTS AFTER A WIN AND LESS RISKY INVESTMENTS AFTER A LOSS; THIS LEADS TO HIGHER (LOWER) RETURNS IN THE STOCK MARKET. THESE HYPOTHESES ARE TESTED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MATCHES OF TURKEY'S THREE MOST POPULAR TEAMS (BESIKTAS, FENERBAHCE, AND GALATASARAY).

"KOYAMA K, 2013, INT J SPORTS MED";"SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN A HIGHER PREVALENCE OF RADIOLOGICAL ABNORMALITIES AMONG GYMNASTS. HOWEVER, THE TYPES OF RADIOLOGICAL ABNORMALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH LOW BACK PAIN (LBP) HAVE NOT BEEN CLARIFIED. THE HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN RADIOLOGICAL ABNORMALITIES AND LBP MAY BE REVEALED BY DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN THE TYPES OF MRI ABNORMALITIES WHILE CONSIDERING CONFOUNDING FACTORS. THE SUBJECTS WERE 104 JAPANESE COLLEGIATE GYMNASTS (MEN, 70; WOMEN, 34). THE PRESENCE OF LBP WAS EVALUATED USING THE QUESTIONNAIRE DEVELOPED BY OSAKA CITY UNIVERSITY (OCU TEST). MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) ABNORMALITIES WERE EVALUATED USING T1- AND T2-WEIGHTED MRI. THE PREVALENCE OF MORE THAN 1 MRI ABNORMALITY IN GYMNASTS WAS 47.1 \% (49/104). THE CHI-SQUARE TEST SHOWED THAT THE INCIDENCE OF LUMBAR DISC DEGENERATION (LDDG) AND LIMBUS VERTEBRA WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IN GYMNASTS WITH LBP THAN IN GYMNASTS WITHOUT LBP. BY USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS TO ANALYZE THE CONCOMITANT ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES, ONLY LDDG (ODDS RATIO, 2.70; 95 \% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, 1.10-6.66) WAS SELECTED AS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE ACCOUNTING FOR LBP. IN CONCLUSION, LDDG IS A PREDICTOR FOR LBP IN JAPANESE COLLEGIATE GYMNASTS."
"KAVUKCU E, 2013, BALK MED J";"OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE PREVALENCE OF MEDICATION AND NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENT USE IN MALE FOOTBALL SUPER LEAGUE PLAYERS AND TO OBSERVE THE LONG TERM CHANGES OF PLAYERS' ATTITUDES DURING 5 YEARS PERIOD (4 SEASONS). STUDY DESIGN: RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. MATERIAL AND METHODS: REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF 4176 DOPING CONTROL FORMS -DECLARATION REPORTS- ABOUT PLAYERS' MEDICATION INTAKE INCLUDING; SUPER LEAGUE, UEFA CUP AND THE UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE MATCHES. TEAM PHYSICIAN WAS ASKED TO DOCUMENT ALL MEDICATIONS AND NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS TAKEN BY THE FOOTBALL SUPER LEAGUE PLAYERS IN THE LAST 72 HOURS BEFORE EACH MATCH. RESULTS: A TOTAL INTAKE OF 5939 SUBSTANCES WERE DOCUMENTED, OF WHICH ALMOST HALF 49.2\% (N=2921) WERE CLASSIFIED AS MEDICATIONS AND 50.8\% (N=3018) WERE NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS. THE AVERAGE CONSUMPTION PER PLAYER WAS 1.42 SUBSTANCE/MATCH; 0.70 WERE MEDICATIONS AND 0.72 OF NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS. THE SUPPLEMENTS USED MOST FREQUENTLY WERE NSAIDS 24.6\% (N=1460) ACCOUNTING FOR ALMOST ONE IN FOUR OF ALL REPORTED SUPPLEMENTS. DICLOFENAC SODIUM WAS THE MOST FREQUENTLY REPORTED ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT. SECOND MOST FREQUENTLY USED SUPPLEMENTS WERE VITAMINS (22.2\%). THE AVERAGE DRUG CONSUMPTION REPORTED PER PLAYER HAS BEEN INCREASING EVERY PASSING YEAR. IT WAS 0.7 SUBSTANCE/MATCH/PLAYER (0.4 MEDICATION; 0.3 NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENT) IN 2003-2004 SEASON; WAS INCREASED TO 1.8 SUBSTANCE/MATCH (0.8 MEDICATION; 1.0 NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENT) IN 2006-2007 SEASON. CONCLUSION: THE TRENDS SEEN IN THIS SURVEY POINT TO AN OVERUSE OF NSAIDS AND VITAMINS IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER MEDICATIONS, AMOUNG TURKISH SUPER LEAGUE FOOTBALL PLAYERS (P<0.001). THE USE OF NSAIDS HAS INCREASED BUT THE MEDICATION GROUPS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN SEASONS, IN TERMS OF DISTRIBUTION. THIS INCREASING USE OF MEDICATIONS ESPECIALLY OF NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS AND NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS IS ALARMING AND NEEDS TO BE ARGUED."
"RISALITI G, 2013, ACCOUNT AUDIT ACCOUNT";"PURPOSE - THIS STUDY SEEKS TO EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF THE GAMUT OF CHANGES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE PAST 15 YEARS IN THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL FOOTBALL THAT HAVE PERMANENTLY TRANSFORMED FOOTBALL FROM A GAME INTO A REAL BUSINESS, WHILE ALSO CONSIDERING SOME SPECIFIC EVENTS THAT HAVE AFFECTED ITALIAN FOOTBALL IN TERMS OF THE VALUATION OF PLAYERS' REGISTRATION RIGHTS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE LEADING ITALIAN FOOTBALL CLUBS THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD 1996-2009. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE LEADING ITALIAN CLUBS. THE CLUBS CONSIDERED WERE THOSE THAT, IN THE PERIOD EXAMINED, QUALIFIED AT LEAST FIVE TIMES FOR A PLACE IN THE ITALIAN SERIE A CHAMPIONSHIP WHICH IS INSTRUMENTAL TO THEIR DIRECT PARTICIPATION, OR THROUGH THE QUALIFYING ROUND, IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE. FINDINGS - THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT QUESTIONABLE WINDOW DRESSING POLICIES, CONSISTING OF ARTIFICIALLY OVERESTIMATED VALUES OF PLAYERS' REGISTRATION RIGHTS, AGGRAVATED THE ITALIAN FOOTBALL CRISIS THAT EXPLODED DURING THE 2001/2002 SEASON. HOWEVER, THE ORIGINS OF THIS CRISIS MUST BE ASCRIBED TO THE INABILITY OF ITALIAN TEAMS TO CONTROL PLAYERS' WAGES. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE STUDY CONCERNS ONLY THE LEADING CLUBS AND EXAMINES THE VALUE OF PLAYERS' REGISTRATION RIGHTS AS AN AGGREGATE, AS IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO EXTRAPOLATE FROM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE VALUES ATTRIBUTED TO INDIVIDUAL PLAYERS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE ITALIAN LEGAL SYSTEM, UNLIKE OTHERS, ESTABLISHES FOR CORPORATIONS, THE OBLIGATION TO RECAPITALIZE IF LOSSES EXCEED A CERTAIN LEVEL. BASED ON THIS PARTICULAR REGULATION, THIS RESEARCH, SUGGESTING A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF EVENTS, IDENTIFIES THE WINDOW DRESSING POLICIES IMPLEMENTED BY ITALIAN FOOTBALL CLUBS DURING THE PERIOD IN QUESTION AS BEHAVIOR DESIGNED TO EVADE THE OBLIGATION TO COVER LOSSES, AND HIGHLIGHTS THE REAL PURPOSE OF THE EXCEPTIONAL MEASURES UNDERTAKEN BY THE ITALIAN LEGISLATOR TO SAVE THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY."
"CULLEN FT, 2012, CRIMINOL PUBLIC POLICY";"ALTHOUGH THE POPULAR AND ACADEMIC MEDIA OFTEN PROCLAIM THAT RULE VIOLATIONS ARE WIDESPREAD IN COLLEGE ATHLETICS, RESEARCH ASSESSING THE TRUE PREVALENCE AND CAUSES OF SUCH INFRACTIONS IS IN SHORT SUPPLY. TO ADDRESS THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP, WE CONDUCTED A NATIONAL SURVEY THAT ASKED A RANDOM SAMPLE OF MALE STUDENT-ATHLETES AT DIVISION I BASKETBALL AND FOOTBALL PROGRAMS ABOUT SUCH INFRACTIONS (N = 648). THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT ALTHOUGH SIX IN TEN STUDENT-ATHLETES DID NOT COMMIT ANY INFRACTIONS IN THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS, SEVEN IN TEN RESPONDENTS REPORTED BREAKING NCAA RULES WHILE IN COLLEGE. MOST VIOLATIONS, HOWEVER, WERE RELATIVELY MINOR AND INVOLVED AMENITIES THAT WOULD ENHANCE THE STUDENT-ATHLETES' QUALITY OF LIFE (FREE MEALS, CASH PAYMENTS LESS THAN \$20). IN CONTRAST, SERIOUS VIOLATIONS-SUCH AS FREE CARS, SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL ALLOCATIONS, AND ACADEMIC FRAUD-WERE RARE, ALTHOUGH THEY DID EXIST. THE MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT INFRACTIONS WERE HIGHER AMONG STUDENT-ATHLETES WHO WERE HIGHLY RECRUITED; WHO ASSOCIATED WITH FELLOW ATHLETES THAT TRANSGRESSED NCAA RULES OR SAW NOTHING INAPPROPRIATE ABOUT BREAKING THESE REGULATIONS; WHO PERSONALLY EMBRACED VALUES DEFINING RULE VIOLATIONS AS ACCEPTABLE; WHO DID NOT HAVE CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR PARENTS; AND, IN PARTICULAR, WHO HAD A GENERAL PROPENSITY TO BE INVOLVED IN DEVIANT BEHAVIOR. IN CONTRAST, INFRACTIONS WERE STATISTICALLY UNRELATED TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MOST NOTABLY ECONOMIC DEPRIVATION, ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT, AND THREATS OF SANCTIONS. A POTENTIALLY DISQUIETING FINDING IS THAT A QUARTER OF THE RESPONDENTS ADMITTED TO GAMBLING ON SPORTING EVENTS, WITH A SMALL PERCENTAGE REPORTING PLACING BETS ON GAMES IN WHICH THEY PLAYED AND THREE RESPONDENTS STATING THAT THEY HAD ``RECEIVED MONEY FROM A GAMBLER FOR NOT PLAYING WELL.''"

EMPIRICAL RESULTS DOCUMENTED THAT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE QUALITY (HIGHER MANAGERIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP, INCREASED BOARD SIZE AND INDEPENDENCE, AND THE SEPARATION OF THE CEO AND CHAIRMAN ROLES) LEADS TO GREATER LEVELS OF PROFITABILITY AND VIABILITY. FURTHER ANALYSIS BASED ON CLUBS' PROFITABILITY AND VIABILITY INDICATES THAT SOUND GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT FOR THOSE CLUBS WITH INTENSE PROBLEMS OF INSOLVENCY AND LOW FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY DICTATE THE NECESSITY OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES FOR PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF SHAREHOLDERS AND VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS AND FOR MAXIMIZING THE CLUBS' ECONOMIC RESULTS AND SOCIAL RETURN. THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS ARE ROBUST TO SEVERAL SENSITIVITY TESTS CONCERNING THE SPECIFICATION OF THE MODELS AND THE MEASURES OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE."

METHODS: A SAMPLE OF 100 URBAN AND RURAL DISADVANTAGED SCHOOLS WAS RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM TWO EDUCATION DISTRICTS OF THE WESTERN CAPE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT, SOUTH AFRICA. A SITUATION ANALYSIS, WHICH COMPRISED AN INTERVIEW WITH THE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL AND COMPLETION OF AN OBSERVATION SCHEDULE OF THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT, WAS DONE AT ALL SCHOOLS. RESULTS: SCHOOLS, ON AVERAGE, HAD 560 LEARNERS AND 16 EDUCATORS. PRINCIPALS PERCEIVED THE TOP HEALTH PRIORITIES FOR LEARNERS TO BE AN UNHEALTHY DIET (50\%) AND TO FAR LESSER DEGREE, LACK OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (24\%) AND UNDERWEIGHT (16\%). THEY CITED LACK OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (33\%) AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES (NCDS; 24\%) AS THE MAIN HEALTH PRIORITIES FOR EDUCATORS, WHILE SUBSTANCE ABUSE (66\%) AND TOBACCO USE (31\%) WERE PRIORITISED FOR PARENTS. MAIN BARRIERS TO HEALTH PROMOTION PROGRAMMES INCLUDED LACK OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND TOO LITTLE TIME IN THE TIME TABLE. THE MOST COMMON ITEMS SOLD AT THE SCHOOL TUCK SHOPS WERE CRISPS (100\%), AND THEN SWEETS (96\%), WHILE VENDORS MAINLY SOLD SWEETS (92\%), CRISPS (89\%), AND ICE LOLLIES (38\%). VERY FEW SCHOOLS (8\%) HAD POLICIES GOVERNING THE TYPE OF FOOD ITEMS SOLD AT SCHOOL. TWENTY-SIX OF THE 100 SCHOOLS THAT WERE VISITED HAD VEGETABLE GARDENS. ALL SCHOOLS REPORTED HAVING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION IN THEIR TIME TABLES, HOWEVER, NOT ALL OF THEM OFFERED THIS ACTIVITY OUTSIDE THE CLASS ROOM. EXTRAMURAL SPORT OFFERED AT SCHOOLS MAINLY INCLUDED ATHLETICS, NETBALL, AND RUGBY, WITH CRICKET AND SOCCER BEING OFFERED LESS FREQUENTLY. CONCLUSION: THE FORMATIVE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTE TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF KEY ENVIRONMENTAL AND POLICY DETERMINANTS THAT MAY PLAY A ROLE IN THE HEALTH BEHAVIOUR OF LEARNERS, THEIR PARENTS AND THEIR EDUCATORS. EVIDENTLY, THESE SHOW THAT SCHOOL ENVIRONMENTS ARE NOT ALWAYS CONDUCIVE TO HEALTHY LIFESTYLES. TO ADDRESS THE IDENTIFIED DETERMINANTS RELATING TO LEARNERS IT IS NECESSARY TO INTERVENE ON THE VARIOUS LEVELS OF INFLUENCE, I.E. PARENTS, EDUCATORS, AND THE SUPPORT SYSTEMS FOR THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING THE CURRICULUM, FOOD AVAILABLE AT SCHOOL, RESOURCES FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AS WELL AS APPROPRIATE POLICIES IN THIS REGARD."
"RASCHER DA, 2012, J SPORT ECON";"ONE OF THE ABSOLUTES IN PROFESSIONAL SPORTS, AND A REASON FOR ITS SUCCESS, IS THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE OUTCOME OF INDIVIDUAL GAMES, SEASONS, AND CHAMPIONSHIPS. THIS UNCERTAINTY IMPACTS A TEAM'S ATTENDANCE AND FINANCIAL OPERATION. WHILE LEAGUES CULTIVATE UNCERTAINTY THROUGH VARIOUS RULES SUCH AS SALARY CAPS, REVENUE SHARING, AND THE AMATEUR DRAFT, INDIVIDUAL FRANCHISES HAVE TO MANAGE THE RESULT OF VARIABILITY IN ANNUAL REVENUES. NOT ONLY IS THIS DUE TO THE PARITY IN A LEAGUE BUT ALSO FROM INJURIES AND CHANGES IN PLAYER QUALITY THAT ARE UNEXPECTED. WHETHER UNCERTAINTY OR WINNING OR THE PERFECT COMBINATION OF THE TWO, SOME ASPECTS THAT AFFECT REVENUES CAN BE CONTROLLED BY TEAM MANAGEMENT MORE SO THAN OTHERS. EVEN THOUGH ON-THE-FIELD SUCCESS IS NOT EASILY CONTROLLED BY TEAM MANAGEMENT, THE OVERALL QUALITY OF THE EXPERIENCE CAN BE IMPACTED FROM, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A QUALITY STADIUM WITH COMFORTABLE SEATING AND DELECTABLE FOOD. THIS RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE VARIABILITY IN ANNUAL TEAM REVENUES DECREASES (RELATIVE TO TOTAL REVENUES) ONCE A TEAM MOVES INTO A NEW STADIUM, ALL ELSE EQUAL. THE INCREASE IN PREDICTABILITY LOWERS FINANCIAL RISK, IMPACTING THE COST OF FINANCING AND OTHER PRACTICAL OPERATIONAL ISSUES LIKE GAME-DAY STAFFING."

POTENTIAL FACTORS THAT MIGHT AFFECT, OR BE INFLUENCED BY, COMPETITIVE BALANCE ARE ALSO EXPLORED. USING ALTERNATIVE INDICATORS OF COMPETITIVE BALANCE, THE RESEARCH FOUND THAT WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME THE ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE HAS BECOME LESS COMPETITIVE, WHICH COINCIDES WITH THE GROWING INCIDENCE OF OVERSEAS INVESTMENT IN ENGLISH CLUBS. THE FRENCH LIGUE 1 EMERGED AS THE MOST COMPETITIVE LEAGUE (OUT OF TEN) IN EUROPE ON MOST INDICATORS IN 2010, WHEREAS THE DUTCH EREDIVISE WAS THE LEAST BALANCED. FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED A STRONG STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEAGUE COMPETITIVENESS AND LEAGUE SIZE (NUMBER OF CLUBS) AND A MODERATELY STRONG, ALBEIT INSIGNIFICANT, EFFECT OF A LEAGUE'S COMPETITIVE BALANCE ON ITS POPULARITY (ATTENDANCE). HOWEVER, THE LINK BETWEEN COMPETITIVENESS AND THE PERCEIVED QUALITY OF COUNTRIES' FOOTBALL LEAGUES (AS PER UEFA ASSOCIATION RANKINGS) WAS RELATIVELY MODEST AND INSIGNIFICANT. THE FINDINGS PROVIDE A USEFUL BASELINE FOR EXAMINING THE EFFECT OF UEFA'S FINANCIAL FAIR PLAY REGULATIONS ON THE COMPETITIVENESS OF FOOTBALL LEAGUES ACROSS KEY EUROPEAN MARKETS IN THE YEARS TO COME."

TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, WE ILLUSTRATE THE EMPIRICAL BACKGROUND AND SEARCH FOR A THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATION WITHIN THE FIELD OF SPORT ECONOMICS. BASED ON STRUCTURING UEFA'S OBJECTIVES, WE ANALYZE AND EVALUATE THE MAJOR AMENDMENTS OF THE FINANCIAL FAIR PLAY REGULATIONS."

J STRENGTH COND RES 26(4): 995-1000, 2012-THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE NEED TO NORMALIZE, FOR BODY MASS, EXPLOSIVE FUNCTIONAL TASKS IN A POPULATION EXHIBITING DIVERSE BODY MASSES. MEASURES INVESTIGATED IN ELITE COLLEGE AMERICAN FOOTBALL PLAYERS ATTENDING THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE'S ANNUAL COMBINE (N = 1,136) WERE THE 9.1-, 18.3-, AND 36.6-M SPRINTS, VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL JUMPS, 18.3-M SHUTTLE, AND 3-CONE DRILL. TO DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BODY MASS AND PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES, PEARSON'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS (R) WERE GENERATED USING LOG-TRANSFORMED DATA. TASK-SPECIFIC ALLOMETRIC EXPONENTS, ACCOUNTING FOR BODY MASS, WERE ALSO DETERMINED. THE STRENGTH OF THE CORRELATIONS SUGGESTS THAT SPRINT AND JUMP ABILITIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH BODY MASS, WHEREAS CHANGE-OF-DIRECTION ABILITY IS NOT. THE DETERMINED ALLOMETRIC EXPONENTS RANGE BETWEEN 0.296 AND -0.463 FOR THE SPRINT AND JUMP TASKS AND ARE -0.022 AND -0.006 FOR THE 18.3-M SHUTTLE AND THE 3-CONE DRILL, RESPECTIVELY. IN POPULATIONS EXHIBITING RELATIVELY LARGE VARIATIONS IN BODY MASS, NORMALIZATION OF SPRINT AND JUMP ABILITIES IS RECOMMENDED, WHEREAS NORMALIZATION OF CHANGE-OF-DIRECTION ABILITY IS UNWARRANTED. NOVEL SUGGESTIONS DERIVED FROM THE PRESENT RESEARCH ARE THAT SPRINT AND JUMP ABILITIES IN DIVERSE POPULATIONS WARRANT NORMALIZATION AND THAT PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES ASSOCIATED WITH EXPLOSIVE FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENTS DESERVE ATTRIBUTE-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATION WHEN CONTEMPLATING NORMALIZATION."

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT FANS' ALLOCATIONS OF TIME, EFFORT, AND FINANCIAL EXPENDITURES TO THE SPORTS THEY CARE MOST ABOUT OR HOW THEY DETERMINE THEIR ALLOCATIONS. THE OBJECTIVE OF OUR RESEARCH IS TO EXPLORE THE DIMENSIONS OF SPORTS CONSUMPTION AND FAN AVIDITY, AND THE NATURE OF HETEROGENEITY OF SUCH DEMAND ASPECTS VIS-A-VIS DERIVED MARKET SEGMENTS. WE DEVELOP A NEW CONSTRAINED LATENT-STRUCTURE MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING PROCEDURE TO UNCOVER THE UNDERLYING DIMENSIONS OF SPORTS CONSUMPTION AND FAN AVIDITY FOR STUDENT COLLEGE FOOTBALL FANS AT A LARGE UNIVERSITY, AND SIMULTANEOUSLY DERIVE LATENT MARKET SEGMENTS TO EXPLORE DEMAND HETEROGENEITY. WE COLLECTED DATA FROM A SAMPLE OF STUDENT FOOTBALL FANS FROM A LARGE US PUBLIC UNIVERSITY KNOWN FOR ITS EXCELLENCE IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL. WE DEVELOPED 35 EXPRESSIONS OF MANIFESTATIONS OF FAN AVIDITY AND INVESTIGATED HOW THESE COLLEGE FANS FOLLOW AND SUPPORT THEIR FOOTBALL TEAM. WE THEN EXTRACTED FOUR INTERPRETABLE DIMENSIONS AND FOUR MARKET SEGMENTS WITH THE APPLICATION OF THIS NEW SPATIAL MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING MODEL. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS OF APPLYING THIS NEW LATENT-STRUCTURE PROCEDURE TO THIS COLLEGE FOOTBALL CONTEXT."

DESIGN: RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW. SETTING: UNIVERSITY LEVEL I TRAUMA CENTER. PARTICIPANTS/PATIENTS: ACUTE TIBIA FRACTURES IN 626 PATIENTS BETWEEN JULY 2006 AND JUNE 2009. METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF 626 CONSECUTIVE TIBIA FRACTURES TREATED BY OUR DEPARTMENT BETWEEN JULY 2006 AND JUNE 2009 WAS PERFORMED. WE RECORDED THE MECHANISM AND TYPE OF FRACTURE AS WELL AS WHETHER OR NOT ACS DEVELOPED. SOCCER AND FOOTBALL INJURIES WERE ANALYZED AS SPECIFIC GROUPS. CHI SQUARE WAS USED TO ANALYZE OUR RESULTS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: THE RATE OF ACS IN PATIENTS INJURED DURING SPORTING EVENTS VERSUS THAT OF ALL PATIENTS WITH A TIBIA FRACTURE. RESULTS: THIRTY-FOUR PATIENTS (5.4\%) DEVELOPED ACS, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE. NINE PATIENTS SUSTAINED THE INJURY WHILE PLAYING SOCCER (1.4\% OF PATIENTS), WHEREAS 11 PATIENTS (1.7\%) WERE INJURED PLAYING FOOTBALL.

CLUBS SPEND DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF MONEY ON THEIR PLAYERS AND USE DIFFERENT INCENTIVE DEVICES TO ACHIEVE THEIR AIMS FOR EACH SEASON. OUR FIRST AIM IS TO FIND OUT WHETHER CLUBS ARE SPENDING MORE MONEY THAN THEY NEED TO. EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THIS IS THE CASE FOR SEVERAL CLUBS, SUGGESTING THAT BUYING PLAYERS SOLELY WITH A VIEW TO SELLING THEM ON FOR FUTURE FINANCIAL GAIN CAN SERIOUSLY DAMAGE CLUBS' ACCOUNTS AND EFFICIENCY. THIS IS ALL THE MORE REMARKABLE AS THE COMPETITIVE LEVEL IS INCREASING AND UNION OF EUROPEAN FOOTBALL ASSOCIATIONS (UEFA) IS ISSUING MORE STRINGENT FINANCIAL STABILITY CONDITIONS. OUR SECOND AIM IS TO ASCERTAIN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PLAYERS' WAGE DISTRIBUTION AND THE CLUBS' EFFICIENCY. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT A HIGHER WAGE SPREAD TENDS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN EFFICIENCY. THE IMPLICATION IS THAT CLUBS SHOULD STRUCTURE WAGES SO AS TO HAVE THE OPTIMAL PAY RANKING FOR INDUCING PLAYERS' EFFORT."
"LAGO-BALLESTEROS J, 2012, J SPORTS SCI";"THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ANALYSE THE INFLUENCE OF PLAYING TACTICS, OPPONENT INTERACTION AND SITUATIONAL VARIABLES ON ACHIEVING SCORE-BOX POSSESSIONS IN PROFESSIONAL SOCCER. THE SAMPLE WAS CONSTITUTED BY 908 POSSESSIONS OBTAINED BY A TEAM FROM THE SPANISH SOCCER LEAGUE IN 12 MATCHES PLAYED DURING THE 2009-2010 SEASON. MULTIDIMENSIONAL QUALITATIVE DATA OBTAINED FROM 12 ORDERED CATEGORICAL VARIABLES WERE USED. SAMPLED MATCHES WERE REGISTERED BY THE AMISCO PRO (R) SYSTEM. DATA WERE ANALYSED USING CHI-SQUARE ANALYSIS AND MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS. OF 908 POSSESSIONS, 303 (33.4\%) PRODUCED SCORE-BOX POSSESSIONS, 477 (52.5\%) ACHIEVED PROGRESSION AND 128 (14.1\%) FAILED TO REACH ANY SORT OF PROGRESSION. MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION SHOWED THAT, FOR THE MAIN VARIABLE ``TEAM POSSESSION TYPE'' DIRECT ATTACKS AND COUNTERATTACKS WERE THREE TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE THAN ELABORATE ATTACKS FOR PRODUCING A SCORE-BOX POSSESSION (P < 0.05). TEAM POSSESSION ORIGINATING FROM THE MIDDLE ZONES AND PLAYING AGAINST LESS THAN SIX DEFENDING PLAYERS (P < 0.001) REGISTERED A HIGHER SUCCESS THAN THOSE STARTED IN THE DEFENSIVE ZONE WITH A BALANCED DEFENCE. WHEN THE TEAM WAS DRAWING OR WINNING, THE PROBABILITY OF REACHING THE SCORE-BOX DECREASED BY 43 AND 53 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH THE LOSING SITUATION (P < 0.05). ACCOUNTING FOR OPPONENT INTERACTIONS AND SITUATIONAL VARIABLES IS CRITICAL TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OFFENSIVE PLAYING TACTICS ON PRODUCING SCORE-BOX POSSESSIONS."

WITH PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES SOUGHT-AFTER BY CONSUMERS AND RESPONSIBLE FOR ADDICTION ISSUES, NICOTINE IS THE MAIN REASON OF THIS PHENOMENON. ACCORDINGLY, SMOKELESS TOBACCO PRODUCTS ARE OF GROWING POPULARITY IN SPORT OWING TO POTENTIAL PERFORMANCE ENHANCING PROPERTIES AND ABSENCE OF ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM. NEVERTHELESS, NICOTINE DOES NOT APPEAR ON THE 2011 WORLD ANTI-DOPING AGENCY (WADA) PROHIBITED LIST OR MONITORING PROGRAM BY LACK OF A COMPREHENSIVE LARGE-SCALE PREVALENCE SURVEY. THUS, THIS WORK DESCRIBES A ONE-YEAR MONITORING STUDY ON URINE SPECIMENS FROM PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES OF DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES COVERING 2010 AND 2011. A METHOD FOR THE DETECTION AND QUANTIFICATION OF NICOTINE, ITS MAJOR METABOLITES (COTININE, TRANS-3-HYDROXYCOTININE, NICOTINE-N'-OXIDE AND COTININE-N-OXIDE) AND MINOR TOBACCO ALKALOIDS (ANABASINE, ANATABINE AND NORNICOTINE) WAS DEVELOPED, RELYING ON ULTRA-HIGH PRESSURE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY COUPLED TO TRIPLE QUADRUPOLE MASS SPECTROMETRY (UHPLC-TQ-MS/MS). A SIMPLE AND FAST DILUTE-AND-SHOOT SAMPLE TREATMENT WAS PERFORMED, FOLLOWED BY HYDROPHILIC INTERACTION CHROMATOGRAPHY-TANDEM MASS SPECTROMETRY (HILIC-MS/MS) OPERATED IN POSITIVE ELECTROSPRAY IONIZATION (ESI) MODE WITH MULTIPLE REACTION MONITORING (MRM) DATA ACQUISITION.

LIKEWISE, HYPOTHESIZING CONSERVATIVE CONCENTRATION LIMITS FOR ACTIVE NICOTINE CONSUMPTION PRIOR AND/OR DURING SPORT PRACTICE (50 NG/ML FOR NICOTINE, COTININE AND TRANS-3-HYDROXYCOTININE AND 25 NG/ML FOR NICOTINE-N'-OXIDE, COTININE-N-OXIDE, ANABASINE, ANATABINE AND NORNICOTINE) REVEALED A PREVALENCE OF 15.3\% AMONGST ATHLETES. WHILE THIS NUMBER MAY APPEAR LOWER THAN THE WORLDWIDE SMOKING PREVALENCE OF AROUND 25\%, FOCUSING THE STUDY ON SELECTED SPORTS HIGHLIGHTED MORE ALARMING FINDINGS. INDEED, ACTIVE NICOTINE CONSUMPTION IN ICE HOCKEY, SKIING, BIATHLON, BOBSLEIGH, SKATING, FOOTBALL, BASKETBALL, VOLLEYBALL, RUGBY, AMERICAN FOOTBALL, WRESTLING AND GYMNASTICS WAS FOUND TO RANGE BETWEEN 19.0 AND 55.6\%. THEREFORE, CONSIDERING THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF SMOKING ON THE RESPIRATORY TRACT AND NUMEROUS HEALTH THREATS DETRIMENTAL TO SPORT PRACTICE AT TOP LEVEL, LIKELIHOOD OF SMOKELESS TOBACCO CONSUMPTION FOR PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT IS GREATLY SUPPORTED.

"SPENCER M, 2011, INT J SPORT PHYSIOL PERFORM";"VARIATIONS IN RATES OF GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT IN YOUNG FOOTBALL PLAYERS CAN INFLUENCE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG VARIOUS FITNESS QUALITIES. PURPOSE: TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN REPEATED-SPRINT ABILITY AND OTHER FUNDAMENTAL FITNESS QUALITIES OF ACCELERATION, AGILITY, EXPLOSIVE LEG POWER, AND AEROBIC CONDITIONING THROUGH THE AGE GROUPS OF U11 TO U18 IN HIGHLY TRAINED JUNIOR FOOTBALL PLAYERS. METHODS: MALE PLAYERS (N = 119) ACROSS THE AGE GROUPS COMPLETED A FITNESS ASSESSMENT BATTERY OVER TWO TESTING SESSIONS. THE FIRST SESSION CONSISTED OF COUNTERMOVEMENT JUMPS WITHOUT AND WITH ARM SWING, 15-M SPRINT RUN, 15-M AGILITY RUN, AND THE 20-M SHUTTLE RUN (U11 TO U15) OR THE YO-YO INTERMITTENT RECOVERY TEST, LEVEL 1 (U16 TO U18). THE PLAYERS WERE TESTED FOR REPEATED-SPRINT ABILITY IN THE SECOND TESTING SESSION USING A PROTOCOL OF 6 X 30-M SPRINTS ON 30 S WITH AN ACTIVE RECOVERY. RESULTS: THE CORRELATIONS OF REPEATED-SPRINT ABILITY WITH THE ASSORTED FITNESS TESTS VARIED CONSIDERABLY BETWEEN THE AGE GROUPS, ESPECIALLY FOR AGILITY (R = .02 TO .92) AND EXPLOSIVE LEG POWER (R = .04 TO .84). CORRELATIONS OF REPEATED SPRINT ABILITY WITH ACCELERATION (R = .48 TO .93) AND AEROBIC CONDITIONING (R = .28 TO .68) WERE LESS VARIABLE WITH AGE. CONCLUSION: REPEATED-SPRINT ABILITY ASSOCIATES DIFFERENTLY WITH OTHER FUNDAMENTAL FITNESS TESTS THROUGHOUT THE TEENAGE YEARS IN HIGHLY TRAINED FOOTBALL PLAYERS, ALTHOUGH STABILIZATION OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS OCCURS BY THE AGE OF 18 Y. COACHES IN JUNIOR FOOTBALL SHOULD PRESCRIBE PHYSICAL TRAINING ACCOUNTING FOR VARIATIONS IN SHORT-TERM DISRUPTIONS OR IMPAIRMENT OF PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE DURING THIS DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD."

THE PRIMARY SOURCES CONSIST OF 27 SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS COMPLEMENTED BY WRITTEN SOURCES AND CONTROLLED FOR CONSTRUCT VALIDITY, EXTERNAL VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY. FINDINGS - FROM A THEORETICAL POINT OF VIEW, A SPORT LEAGUE IS A MARKETING CHANNEL NETWORK (A SPECIFIC TYPE OF AN INTENTIONALLY DEVELOPED BUSINESS NETWORK OR IDBN). THEORETICAL ANALYSIS ALSO REVEALS THAT THE TEAMS' BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS MARKETING IS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE NETWORK'S VALUE-CREATING SYSTEM. EMPIRICALLY, IT IS ARGUED THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF A MARKETING CHANNEL NETWORK HAS A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON THE FINANCIAL VALUE OF THE TEAMS' BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS MARKET BUT DOES NOT RESULT IN A CHANGE IN THE BUSINESS DEMOGRAPHICS OF CORPORATE SPONSORS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS - THE STUDY HAS POSSIBLE SPORT-SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS MARKETERS AND SPORT LEAGUE MANAGERS SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SPORT LEAGUE AS THESE INFLUENCE THE TEAMS' BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS MARKET. THIS IS ESPECIALLY VALID FOR SPORTS IN WHICH TEAMS RELY STRONGLY ON SPORT SPONSORING AND, TO A LESSER EXTEND, ON GATE REVENUES, TELEVISION RIGHTS AND PRIZE MONEY.

TECHNICAL AND TACTICAL SKILLS IN SOCCER ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE PLAYER'S PHYSICAL CAPACITY. THE SELECTION, DEVELOPMENT AND PROFESSIONAL GUIDANCE OF YOUNG PLAYERS IS A PRIORITY FOR MANY TOP SOCCER CLUBS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THEIR SPORTING AND FINANCIAL STATUS. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE HEMATOLOGICAL PROFILE OF YOUTH NATIONAL SOCCER TENNIS AND TO COMPARE THE VALUES OF FIFTEEN HEMATOLOGICAL PARAMETERS BETWEEN 3 SERBIAN YOUTH NATIONAL TENNIS (TINDER 14, 15 AND 16 YEARS OLD), AS WELL AS BETWEEN SOCCER PLAYERS AND NON-ATHLETES. 80 YOUNG SOCCER PLAYERS AND 30 NON-ATHLETES PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. 15 HEMATOLOGIC PARAMETERS (WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, PLT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, PDW, LYM \%, MON \%, GRAN \%, LYM, MON, GRAN) WERE MEASURED.

"MEER J, 2009, ECON EDUC REV";"AN ONGOING CONTROVERSY IN THE LITERATURE ON THE ECONOMICS OF HIGHER EDUCATION CENTERS ON WHETHER THE SUCCESS OF A SCHOOL'S ATHLETIC PROGRAM AFFECTS ALUMNI DONATIONS. THIS PAPER USES A UNIQUE DATA SET TO INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE. THE DATA CONTAIN DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT DONATIONS MADE BY ALUMNI OF A SELECTIVE RESEARCH UNIVERSITY AS WELL AS A VARIETY OF THEIR ECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS. ONE IMPORTANT QUESTION IS HOW TO CHARACTERIZE THE SUCCESS OF AN ATHLETIC PROGRAM. WE FOCUS NOT ONLY ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MOST VISIBLE TEAMS, FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL, BUT ALSO OIL THE SUCCESS OF THE TEAM ON WHICH HE OR SHE PLAYED AS AN UNDERGRADUATE. ONE OF OUR KEY FINDINGS IS THAT THE IMPACT OF ATHLETIC SUCCESS ON DONATIONS DIFFERS FOR MEN AND WOMEN. WHEN A MALE GRADUATE'S FORMER TEAM WINS ITS CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP, HIS DONATIONS FOR GENERAL PURPOSES INCREASE BY ABOUT 7\% AND HIS DONATIONS TO THE ATHLETIC PROGRAM INCREASE BY ABOUT THE SAME PERCENTAGE. FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL RECORDS GENERALLY HAVE SMALL AND STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT EFFECTS; IN SOME SPECIFICATIONS, A WINNING BASKETBALL SEASON REDUCES DONATIONS. FOR WOMEN THERE IS NO STATISTICALLY DISCERNIBLE EFFECT OF A FORMER TEAM'S SUCCESS ON CURRENT GIVING; AS IS THE CASE FOR MEN, THE IMPACTS OF FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL, WHILE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN SOME SPECIFICATIONS, ARE NOT IMPORTANT IN MAGNITUDE. ANOTHER NOVEL RESULT IS THAT FOR MALES, VARSITY ATHLETES WHOSE TEAMS WERE SUCCESSFUL WHEN THEY WERE UNDERGRADUATES SUBSEQUENTLY MAKE LARGER DONATIONS TO THE ATHLETIC PROGRAM. FOR EXAMPLE, IF A MALE ALUMNUS'S TEAM WON ITS CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP DURING HIS SENIOR YEAR, HIS SUBSEQUENT GIVING TO THE ATHLETIC PROGRAM IS ABOUT 8\% A YEAR HIGHER, CETERIS PARIBUS.

IN THE CURRENT HEALTHCARE ENVIRONMENT, THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF WIDESPREAD CONVERSION TO A DOUBLE-BUNDLE ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION ARE AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION. PURPOSE: TO DETERMINE THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF WIDESPREAD USE OF THE DOUBLE-BUNDLE TECHNIQUE FOR ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION. STUDY DESIGN: ECONOMIC ANALYSIS; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE, 2. METHODS: A COST MODEL TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF DOUBLE-BUNDLE ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION WAS CONSTRUCTED USING STANDARD ACCOUNTING METHODOLOGY. THE MODEL WAS BASED ON ACTUAL 2008 COST FIGURES (IN US DOLLARS) FOR LIGAMENTOUS ALLOGRAFTS, FIXATION IMPLANTS, AND OPERATING ROOM TIME. REVISION RATE (4\%) AND TIME TO REVISION SURGERY (MEAN, 4 YEARS) FOR SINGLE-BUNDLE ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION WAS BASED ON THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE. ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE PREVALENCE OF DOUBLE-BUNDLE VERSUS SINGLE-BUNDLE ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION, THE NUMBER OF GRAFTS USED, AND THE REVISION RATE FOR DOUBLE-BUNDLE RECONSTRUCTION WERE VARIED TO ASSESS THEIR EFFECT ON COST. RESULTS: THE POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL COST FOR WIDESPREAD CONVERSION TO THE DOUBLE-BUNDLE TECHNIQUE FOR ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION RANGES FROM \$36 MILLION TO \$792 MILLION PER YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE. TO OFFSET THIS INCREASED COST, THE DOUBLE-BUNDLE TECHNIQUE WOULD HAVE TO REDUCE THE REVISION RATE AT A MINIMUM FROM 4\% TO 1.5\% AND POTENTIALLY FROM 24.1\% TO 0\%. CONCLUSION: DOUBLE-BUNDLE ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION HAS THE POTENTIAL OF ADDING CONSIDERABLE COST TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: WHILE FURTHER RESEARCH IS WARRANTED TO DETERMINE IF THERE ARE OTHER BENEFITS FROM THIS TECHNIQUE, WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF A DOUBLE-BUNDLE ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE COST-EFFECTIVE AT THIS TIME."

FOR THE STUDY, EIGHTY-NINE 16-18-YEAR-OLD STUDENTS FROM THE FENCING, ATHLETICS, MARTIAL ARTS, AND FOOTBALL CLASSES OF THE SCHOOL OF CHAMPIONSHIP IN SPORTS WERE RECRUITED. EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE DEVELOPED BY MROCZKOWSKA CALLED ``PERCEPTION OF THE RISK OF DOPING'' WAS EMPLOYED TO INDIVIDUALLY RANK THE HIGHLY REGARDED VALUES (E.G., HEALTH, MEDALS WON, PHYSICAL APPEAL, MENTAL BALANCE, FINANCIAL BONUSES, AND SOCIAL RESPECT) THAT CAN BE LOST AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE USE OF ILLEGAL STIMULANTS. IT APPEARS THAT YOUNG ATHLETES WOULD DECLARATIVELY RESIGN THEMSELVES FROM THE LOSS OF A FINANCIAL BONUS RATHER THAN FROM THE LOSS OF THE SOCIAL RESPECT AND ATTRIBUTES OF SELF-INTEGRITY, SUCH AS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. THE DETECTED CORRELATIONS SUGGEST THAT THE REWARDING VALUE OF A MEDAL HAS AN INTERNAL DIMENSION: IT EXTERNALIZES A SENSE OF SELF-CONFIDENCE AND CONFIRMS HIGH SELF-ESTEEM. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT, AS PERCEIVED BY THE YOUNG, WINNING A MEDAL WITH THE HELP OF DOPING IS AN ILLUSION THAT DOES NOT ALLOW TO VERIFY ONE'S OWN SKILLS AND LIMITATIONS.

THE EXCEPTION TO COMPETITIVE PARITY IS THAT THE SALARY CAP, USED TO ENGENDER PARITY DOES NOT INCLUDE COACHING SALARIES. THE FACT THAT TEAMS, ALONG WITH STADIUM OWNERS, CAN EXCHANGE GENERAL SEATING FOR PREMIUM SEATING MAKES THE DEGREE OF REVENUE SHARING AN ENDOGENOUS VARIABLE. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT TEAMS IN LARGER, WEALTHIER MARKETS HAVE A GREATER INCENTIVE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PREMIUM SEATS, AND THUS REDUCE THE DEGREE OF REVENUE SHARING, AND TO ACQUIRE GREATER COACHING TALENT.

BACKGROUND. IN 1982, THE NCAA BEGAN COLLECTING STANDARDIZED INJURY AND EXPOSURE DATA FOR COLLEGIATE SPORTS THROUGH ITS INJURY SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (ISS). THIS SPECIAL ISSUE REVIEWS 182000 INJURIES AND SLIGHTLY MORE THAN 1 MILLION EXPOSURE RECORDS CAPTURED OVER A 16-YEAR TIME PERIOD (1988-1989 THROUGH 2003-2004). GAME AND PRACTICE INJURIES THAT REQUIRED MEDICAL ATTENTION AND RESULTED IN AT LEAST 1 DAY OF TIME LOSS WERE INCLUDED. AN EXPOSURE WAS DEFINED AS 1 ATHLETE PARTICIPATING IN 1 PRACTICE OR GAME AND IS EXPRESSED AS AN ATHLETE-E:KPOSURE (AE). MAIN RESULTS: COMBINING DATA FOR ALL SPORTS, INJURY RATES WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN GAMES (13.8 INJURIES PER 1000 A-ES) THAN IN PRACTICES (4.0 INJURIES PER 1000 A-ES), AND PRESEASON PRACTICE INJURY RATES (6.6 INJURIES PER 1000 A-ES) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN BOTH IN-SEASON (2.3 INJURIES PER 1000 A-ES) AND POSTSEASON (1.4 INJURIES PER 1000 A-ES) PRACTICE RATES. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN GAME OR PRACTICE INJURY RATES WAS NOTED OVER THE 16 YEARS. MORE THAN 50\% OF ALL INJURIES WERE TO THE LOWER EXTREMITY. ANKLE LIGAMENT SPRAINS WERE THE MOST COMMON INJURY OVER ALL SPORTS, ACCOUNTING FOR 15\% OF ALL REPORTED INJURIES. RATES OF CONCUSSIONS AND ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT INJURIES INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (AVERAGE ANNUAL INCREASES OF 7.0\% AND 1.3\%, RESPECTIVELY) OVER THE SAMPLE PERIOD. THESE TRENDS MAY REFLECT IMPROVEMENTS IN IDENTIFICATION OF THESE INJURIES, ESPECIALLY FOR CONCUSSION, OVER TIME. FOOTBALL HAD THE HIGHEST INJURY RATES FOR BOTH PRACTICES (9.6 INJURIES PER 1000 AES) AND GAMES (35.9 INJURIES PER 1000 A-ES), WHEREAS MEN'S BASEBALL HAD THE LOWEST RATE IN PRACTICE (1.9 INJURIES PER 1000 A\_ES) AND WOMEN'S SOFTBALL HAD THE LOWEST RATE IN GAMES (4.3 INJURIES PER 1000 A-ES).

RESPONDENTS WERE ALSO CATEGORIZED ACCORDING TO WHETHER THEY REPORTED DIFFICULTY WITH PAIN AS NOT OR SOMEWHAT COMMON (N = 837; 51.8\%) VERSUS QUITE OR VERY COMMON (N = 769; 47.6\%). RESPONDENTS MOST FREQUENTLY REPORTED TROUBLE SLEEPING, FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, MARITAL OR RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS, AND PROBLEMS WITH FITNESS, EXERCISE, AND AGING, ALL OF WHICH WERE STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH THE PRESENCE OF MODERATE TO SEVERE DEPRESSION AND WITH QUITE OR VERY COMMON DIFFICULTY WITH PAIN. THE SAME DIFFICULTIES WERE EVEN MORE COMMONLY EXPERIENCED BY RESPONDENTS WHO REPORTED BOTH MODERATE TO SEVERE DEPRESSION AND QUITE OR VERY COMMON DIFFICULTY WITH PAIN, COMPARED WITH THOSE WHO REPORTED LOW SCORES IN BOTH DOMAINS. CONCLUSION: RETIRED PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL PLAYERS EXPERIENCE LEVELS OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE GENERAL POPULATION, BUT THE IMPACT OF THESE SYMPTOMS IS COMPOUNDED BY HIGH LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY WITH PAIN. THE COMBINATION OF DEPRESSION AND PAIN IS STRONGLY PREDICTIVE OF SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTIES WITH SLEEP, SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, AND PROBLEMS WITH EXERCISE AND FITNESS. A HYPOTHESIS EXPLAINING THIS ASSOCIATION IS THAT SIGNIFICANT MUSCULOSKELETAL DISABILITY AND CHRONIC PAIN INTERFERES WITH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND FITNESS DURING RETIREMENT AND INCREASES THE RISK OF DEPRESSION."
"NIKOLYCHUK L, 2007, MANAG DECIS";"PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO HELP DEMONSTRATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH SOCIO-CULTURAL AND MARKET-ORIENTED INCENTIVES JOINTLY CONTRIBUTE TO CORPORATE CONTROL OUTCOMES THAT PREVAIL IN THE UK FOOTBALL INDUSTRY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - ILLUSTRATIVE CASE STUDIES INFORMED BY ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DATA, DISCUSSION WITH KEY INFORMANTS, REVIEW OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS. FINDINGS - THE PAPER FINDS LONG TERM PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES WERE INFLUENCED IN SUBSTANTIVE WAYS BY ACTIONS LED BY SHAREHOLDER GROUPS PURSUING LARGELY NON-MARKET-ORIENTED OBJECTIVES. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC EMPIRICAL WORK THAT ANALYSES HOW THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN VOICE AND EXIT STRATEGIES INFLUENCES CORPORATE CONTROL OUTCOMES IS LIMITED. THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON TWO UK CASES AND THEREFORE WOULD BENEFIT EXPANSION TO FURTHER UK CASES AND COMPARATIVE ANALYSES TO NON-UK SITUATIONS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE OUTCOMES SUGGEST THAT THE MARKET FOR CORPORATE CONTROL IN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY CONTEXT REQUIRES SPECIFIC ATTENTION TO ACTIONS DRIVEN BY LARGELY NON-MARKET-DRIVEN INCENTIVES.

"NIKANDER R, 2006, BONE";"THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY OF ADULT FEMALE ATHLETES ASSESSED WHETHER THE APPARENT LOADING-RELATED DIFFERENCES IN BONE STRUCTURE ARE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOADING TYPE OR THE MUSCLE PERFORMANCE-RELATED JOINT MOMENTS. SEVERAL STRUCTURAL VARIABLES AT SHAFT SITES OF THE TIBIA, RADIUS AND HUMERUS, AND DISTAL SITES OF THE TIBIA AND RADIUS WERE MEASURED WITH PERIPHERAL QUANTITATIVE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (PQCT) AMONG 113 FEMALE NATIONAL LEVEL ATHLETES (REPRESENTING HURDLING, VOLLEYBALL, SOCCER, RACKET-SPORTS AND SWIMMING) AND THEIR 30 NONATHLETIC REFERENTS. FOR THE WEIGHT-BEARING LOWER EXTREMITIES, THE LOADING MODALITIES OF THE ABOVE SPORTS WERE CLASSIFIED INTO HIGH-IMPACT (HURDLING, VOLLEYBALL), ODD-IMPACT (SOCCER, RACKET-SPORTS) AND REPETITIVE, NONIMPACT (SWIMMING) LOADINGS; AND FOR THE NONWEIGHT-BEARING UPPER EXTREMITIES INTO HIGH MAGNITUDE (FUNCTIONAL WEIGHTLIFTING IN HURDLING AND SOCCER), IMPACT (VOLLEYBALL, RACKET-SPORTS) AND REPETITIVE, NONIMPACT (SWIMMING) LOADINGS. AS EXPECTED, ATHLETES' BONE MASS WAS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER AT LOADED BONE SITES COMPARED WITH THE NONATHLETIC REFERENTS, BUT MORE PERTINENTLY TO THE LOCOMOTIVE PERSPECTIVE, THE LOADING-INDUCED ADDITIONAL BONE MASS SEEMED TO BE USED TO BUILD MECHANICALLY STRONG AND APPROPRIATE BONE STRUCTURES. COMPARED WITH CONTROLS, THE WEIGHT-BEARING BONE STRUCTURES OF FEMALE ATHLETES (SWIMMERS EXCLUDED) WERE CHARACTERIZED BY LARGER DIAPHYSIS, THICKER CORTICES AND SOMEWHAT DENSER TRABECULAR BONE. THE ATHLETES' BONES AT THE NONWEIGHT-BEARING UPPER EXTREMITY WERE GENERALLY LARGER IN CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA. THE ESTIMATED INDICES OF JOINT MOMENT (MUSCLE FORCE X ESTIMATED LEVER ARM) WERE EXPLAINED FROM 29\% TO 50\%, AND THE LOADING MODALITIES FROM 8\% TO 25\%, OF THE VARIANCE IN MOST BONE VARIABLES (P < 0.05) OF THE TIBIA (SHAFT AND DISTAL SITE). IN CONTRAST TO THE WEIGHT-BEATING TIBIA, ONLY THE ESTIMATED JOINT MOMENT WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED (P < 0.05) WITH THE STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RADIUS AND HUMERUS, ACCOUNTING FOR 6\% TO 26\% OF THE VARIANCE IN BONE VARIABLES OF THE SHAFTS OF THESE BONES. SUCH ASSOCIATION WAS NOT OBSERVED AT THE DISTAL RADIUS. IN CONCLUSION, AT THE WEIGHT-BEARING LOWER EXTREMITY, THE STRONG BONE STRUCTURE OF THE FEMALE ATHLETES WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO MUSCLE PERFORMANCE-RELATED ESTIMATED JOINT MOMENTS AND IMPACT LOADING MODALITY. AT THE SHAFT SITES OF THE NONWEIGHT-BEARING UPPER EXTREMITY, THE STRONG BONE STRUCTURE WAS MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ESTIMATED JOINT MOMENTS.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION WAS TO COMPARE THE RELIABILITY OF 10-M SPRINT TIMES WHEN USING DIFFERENT STARTING TECHNIQUES. JUNIOR MALE RUGBY PLAYERS (N=15) WERE TESTED FOR SPEED OVER 10 M ON 2 DIFFERENT TESTING SESSIONS. THREE TRIALS OF 3 DIFFERENT STARTING TECHNIQUES (STANDING, FOOT, AND THUMB STARTS) WERE ASSESSED. DESPITE LARGE DIFFERENCES IN THE TIME TAKEN TO PERFORM 10-M SPRINTS FROM DIFFERENT STARTS, THERE WAS MINIMAL DIFFERENCE IN THE TYPICAL ERROR (SIMILAR TO 0.02 SECONDS, OR <1\%) BETWEEN THE 3 DIFFERENT STARTS. THERE WAS A SMALL, 0.02 +/- 0.02 SECOND, DECREASE (P=0.05) IN SPRINT TIME BETWEEN SESSIONS FOR THE FOOT START. FOR ALL STARTING TECHNIQUES, THE MAGNITUDE OF ERROR (TYPICAL ERROR) WAS GREATER THAN THE SMALLEST WORTHWHILE CHANGE (<0.01 SECOND), INDICATING THAT ACCELERATION OVER 10 M MEASURED BY PHOTOCELLS ONLY HAS A MARGINAL CHANCE OF RELIABLY DETECTING A CHANGE OF SUFFICIENT MAGNITUDE TO BE WORTHWHILE IN PRACTICAL TERMS. HOWEVER, BY ACCOUNTING FOR THE SMALLEST WORTHWHILE CHANGE AND TYPICAL ERROR, IT IS POSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH THE PROBABILITY AN INDIVIDUAL HAS HAD A WORTHWHILE CHANGE IN SPRINT PERFORMANCE. COACHING AND SPORTS-SCIENCE PRACTITIONERS CAN USE A VARIETY OF SPRINT-START TECHNIQUES SHOWN TO HAVE SMALL TYPICAL ERRORS (<1\%); HOWEVER, THE RESULTS FROM THE DIFFERENT STARTING TECHNIQUE ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE."

METHODS: TIME-MOTION ANALYSIS AND HR RECORDINGS WERE PERFORMED ON 14 ELITE FEMALE SOCCER PLAYERS DURING COMPETITIVE MATCHES. IN ADDITION, THE PLAYERS CARRIED OUT A LABORATORY TREADMILL TEST AND THE YO-YO INTERMITTENT RECOVERY TEST. RESULTS: THE TOTAL DISTANCE COVERED DURING A GAME WAS 10.3 KM (RANGE: 9.7-11.3) WITH HIGH-INTENSITY RUNNING (HIR) ACCOUNTING FOR 1.31 KM (0.71-1.70). HIR WAS PERFORMED 125 TIMES (72-159) FOR 2.3 S (2.0-2.4) ON AVERAGE. THE AVERAGE AND PEAK HR IN A GAME WERE 167 BEATS PER MINUTE (BPM) (152-186) AND 186 (171-205), RESPECTIVELY, CORRESPONDING TO 87\% (81-93) AND 97\% (96-100) OF HRMAX. MAXIMAL PULMONARY OXYGEN UPTAKE ((V) OVER DOT O-2MAX) WAS 49.4 ML CENTER DOT MIN(-1)CENTER DOT KG(-1) (43.4-56.8), AND INCREMENTAL TREADMILL TEST (ITT) PERFORMANCE WAS 4.49 MIN (3.38-5.17). THE YO-YO TEST PERFORMANCE WAS 1379 M (600-1960). THE TOTAL DISTANCE COVERED DURING MATCH PLAY DID NOT CORRELATE WITH (V) OVER DOT O-2MAX OR ITT PERFORMANCE BUT CORRELATED WITH THE YO-YO TEST RESULT (R = 0.56, P < 0.05). SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATIONS WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN HIR AND (V) OVER DOT O-2MAX (R = 0.81, P < 0.05), ITT (R = 0.82, P < 0.05), AND YO-YO TEST PERFORMANCE (R = 0.76, P < 0.05).

PREVIOUS WORK SUGGESTS THAT EVENT INTEREST, RISK CONSTRAINT, AND FINANCIAL CONSTRAINT WILL AFFECT POTENTIAL ATTENDEES' DESIRE TO ATTEND AND THEIR SENSE THAT IT IS FEASIBLE TO ATTEND. FOR LARGE SPORT EVENTS, INTEREST IN THE EVENT AND PERCEIVED CONSTRAINTS SHOULD DERIVE FROM THE LEVEL OF FAN MOTIVES, TRAVEL MOTIVATIONS, AND THE POTENTIAL ATTENDEE'S BACKGROUND. THESE EXPECTATIONS ARE TESTED IN A SURVEY OF 556 MEMBERS OF AMERICAN SOCCER CLUBS PRIOR TO THE FIFA WORLD CUP. RESULTS WERE GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH EXPECTATIONS, ALTHOUGH SOME MOTIVES HAD BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS. EVENT INTEREST AND CONSTRAINTS FULLY MEDIATED THE EFFECTS OF MOTIVES AND BACKGROUND ON RESPONDENTS' SENSE THAT IT WAS FEASIBLE FOR THEM TO ATTEND.

NATIONAL COACHES ( N = 8), YOUTH ACADEMY DIRECTORS ( N = 21) AND ACADEMY COACHES ( N = 27) WERE SURVEYED USING QUESTIONNAIRE AND INTERVIEW METHODS. QUESTIONNAIRE RESULTS REVEALED A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF SPORT PSYCHOLOGY THAT APPEARED TO UNDERPIN SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO ENTRY FOR SPORT PSYCHOLOGISTS. THESE INCLUDED LACK OF CLARITY CONCERNING THE SERVICES OF A SPORT PSYCHOLOGIST, PROBLEMS FITTING IN AND PLAYERS' NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OF SPORT PSYCHOLOGY.

"GERSTENBLUTH RE, 2002, J UROL";"PURPOSE: THE RISK OF MAJOR RENAL INJURY RESULTING FROM VARIOUS FORMS OF SPORTS PARTICIPATION IS UNKNOWN. UROLOGISTS OFTEN RECOMMEND THAT CHILDREN WITH A SOLITARY KIDNEY AVOID CONTACT SPORTS. WE REVIEWED OUR RECENT EXPERIENCE WITH PEDIATRIC RENAL TRAUMA TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF SPORTS ACTIVITY AND HIGH GRADE RENAL INJURY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE RETROSPECTIVELY REVIEWED THE MEDICAL RECORDS OF 68 CONSECUTIVE CHILDREN WITH BLUNT RENAL INJURY WHO WERE TREATED AT 2 LEVEL I TRAUMA CENTERS. INJURIES WERE GRADED USING THE RENAL INJURY SCALE OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE SURGERY OF TRAUMA. RECORDS WERE REVIEWED FOR MECHANISM OF INJURY, ASSOCIATED INJURIES, MANAGEMENT AND INJURY SEVERITY SCORE. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING FISHER'S EXACT TEST OR WILCOXON RANK SUM TEST. RESULTS: OF THE 68 RENAL LESIONS 13 WERE GRADE 1, 15 GRADE 11, 15 GRADE 111, 17 GRADE IV AND 8 GRADE V. THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF RENAL TRAUMA WAS MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS, ACCOUNTING FOR 21 INJURIES (30.1\%). ACCIDENTS ASSOCIATED WITH NONMOTORIZED SPORTS ACTIVITY ACCOUNTED FOR 14 INJURIES (20.6\%). BICYCLE RIDING WAS THE MOST COMMON SPORTS ETIOLOGY, ACCOUNTING FOR 8 OF 14 CASES (57.1\%) AT AN AGE RANGE OF 5 TO 15 YEARS (MEAN 9.4). NONE OF THE BICYCLE INJURIES INVOLVED COLLISION WITH A MOTOR VEHICLE. BICYCLING ACCOUNTED FOR 1 GRADE 1, 1 GRADE 11, 1 GRADE 111, 2 GRADE IV AND 3 GRADE V INJURIES. FOOTBALL, HOCKEY AND SLEDDING WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REMAINING 6 SPORTS RELATED INJURIES. HIGH GRADE RENAL INJURY (GRADE IV OR V) WAS IDENTIFIED IN 5 OF 8 BICYCLE ACCIDENTS (62.5\%) AND 1 OF 6 NONBICYCLE SPORTS RELATED INJURIES (16.7\%, P = 0.14). INJURY SEVERITY SCORES RANGED FROM 4 TO 50 (MEAN 20.6) FOR BICYCLE RENAL INJURIES AND 4 TO 13 (MEAN 6.7) FOR NONBICYCLE SPORTS RELATED TRAUMA (P <0.05). PARENTS INDICATED THAT BLUNT TRAUMA FROM THE HANDLEBARS WAS THE MAJOR FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO RENAL INJURY IN 3 BICYCLE CASES. RENAL TRAUMA FROM BICYCLE RIDING RESULTED IN 1 NEPHRECTOMY. CONCLUSIONS: BICYCLE RIDING IS THE MOST COMMON SPORTS RELATED CAUSE OF RENAL INJURY IN CHILDREN AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF MAJOR RENAL INJURY. FAMILIES OF CHILDREN WITH A SOLITARY KIDNEY SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS RISK FACTOR. TEAM CONTACT SPORTS ARE AN UNCOMMON CAUSE OF HIGH GRADE RENAL INJURY. CURRENT RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING SPORTS PARTICIPATION BY CHILDREN WITH A SOLITARY KIDNEY NEED TO BE REEVALUATED."

"DRAWER S, 2002, SAF SCI";"THE PROCESS OF RISK MANAGEMENT, WHICH IS USED THROUGHOUT INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE, INVOLVES IDENTIFYING WORK ACTIVITIES AND HAZARDS AND ESTIMATING, EVALUATING AND CONTROLLING THE ASSOCIATED RISKS. WITHIN PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL, INJURY RATES ARE SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER THAN THOSE REPORTED IN OTHER OCCUPATIONS. THIS SECTOR, THEREFORE. PROVIDES AN IDEAL ORGANISATIONAL SETTING FOR DEVELOPING AND TESTING THEORIES OF HEALTH AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT. A MAJOR RISK FOR CLUBS ARISES FROM PLAYERS BEING UNAVAILABLE FOR SELECTION THROUGH INJURY, WITH THE POSSIBLE EFFECT THAT THIS MAY HAVE ON THE CLUBS' PLAYING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCES. A STATISTICALLY BASED RISK MANAGEMENT MODEL,WHICH UTILISED FOUR RELATIONSHIPS INVOLVING THE PARAMETERS OF TEAM-QUALITY, TEAM-PERFORMANCE, CLUB-TURNOVER AND CLUB-SALARY, WAS DEVELOPED. THE MODEL WAS BASED ON DATA FROM 91 LEAGUE CLUBS IN ENGLISH PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL OVER THE SEASONS 1993/1994-1997/1998. SIGNIFICANT (P<0,01) STRONG (1-0.80-0.97) CORRELATIONS WERE OBTAINED FOR FOUR LOG-LOG RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE FOUR PARAMETERS. THE MODEL, WHICH INCORPORATED A PLAYER QUALITY VARIABLE, HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO DESCRIBE AND ASSESS THE IMPACT OF PLAYERS' INJURIES ON CLUBS' PLAYING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCES.

"DONGAS P, 2002, AUST DENT J";"BACKGROUND: NO PREVIOUS STUDIES ON MANDIBULAR FRACTURE PATTERNS IN TASMANIA, AND VERY FEW ELSEWHERE IN AUSTRALIA, HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO DISCOVER WHICH IDENTIFIED AGE, GENDER, AETIOLOGY, ANATOMICAL LOCATION OF THE FRACTURE, PERIOD OF INJURY, WHETHER ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INJURY, AND TREATMENT OF MANDIBULAR FRACTURES. METHOD: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN OF 251 PATIENTS WITH FRACTURED MANDIBLES PRESENTING TO THE ROYAL HOBART HOSPITAL, TASMANIA FROM 1993-1999. DATA WERE OBTAINED FROM THE ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY UNIT FRACTURE RECORD BOOKS CROSS-CHECKED WITH PATIENTS, IMPATIENT/OUTPATIENT HOSPITAL RECORDS. RESULTS: THE MALE TO FEMALE RATIO WAS 4.5:1, WITH MANDIBULAR FRACTURES MOST COMMON IN THE MALE AGE GROUP OF 21-30 YEARS. ASSAULTS (55 PER CENT OF ALL PATIENTS) WERE THE MAJOR CAUSE OF FRACTURES. MALES ACCOUNTED FOR 855 PER CENT OF ASSAULTS, WITH PUNCHING BEING THE MOST COMMON METHOD, FOLLOWED BY MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS (MVA), 18.3 PER CENT AND SPORT, 16.7 PER CENT. IN SPORT, AUSTRALIAN RULES FOOTBALL WAS THE MOST COMMON CAUSE, ACCOUNTING FOR 45.2 PER CENT OF SPORTING INJURIES. THE SITE MOST FREQUENTLY FRACTURED WAS THE ANGLE OF THE MANDIBLE. ALCOHOL ABUSE WAS SEEN IN 41.4 PER CENT OF THE PATIENTS WITH 84.6 PER CENT BEING MALE. OPEN REDUCTION AND INTERNAL FIXATION WITH MINIPLATE OSTEOSYNTHESIS, WAS THE PREFERRED TREATMENT MODALITY. THE RESULTS ARE COMPARED WITH OTHER SERIES. CONCLUSIONS: MANDIBULAR FRACTURES ARE COMMON,IN TASMANIA, WITH THE HIGHEST RATES INVOLVED IN ASSAULTS AND SPORT (ESPECIALLY AUSTRALIAN RULES FOOTBALL) AND A LOW RATE IN MVA. THESE FRACTURES COMMONLY OCCURRED IN YOUNG MALES IN WHICH ASSAULTS, ALCOHOL AND SOCIAL ISSUES WERE ASSOCIATED.

SPORTS INJURIES WERE EXAMINED IN SCHOOLS, IN ORGANISED AND UNORGANISED SETTINGS, AND IN SPECIFIC TYPES OF SPORTS BY DEMOGRAPHICS AND INJURY DESCRIPTIVE VARIABLES. SPORTS INJURIES REPRESENT A QUANTITATIVELY IMPORTANT AND SUFFICIENTLY SERIOUS PROBLEM IN EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES, ACCOUNTING FOR AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL NUMBER OF ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILLION OUTPATIENT VISITS IN TWO OF THE PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES, WHICH PROVIDE NATIONAL ESTIMATES. IT IS EVIDENT, THAT SPORT INJURIES ARE NOT ONLY COMMON BUT ALSO INJURIES OF CONSIDERABLE SEVERITY, SINCE A LARGE FRACTION REPRESENTS FRACTURES, WHILE APPROXIMATELY 4\% OF THE TOTAL REQUIRE HOSPITALISATION. FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL AMONG MALE CHILDREN ARE, IN DECLINING ORDER, THE TWO SPORTS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST FREQUENT INJURIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES, WHEREAS GYMNASTICS AND VOLLEYBALL PREVAIL AMONG FEMALES.

METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE 9254 YOUTH FROM THE ADOLESCENT BRAIN COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT STUDY. LATENT FACTORS REFLECTING SMA, COGNITION, PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT WERE ENTERED AS INDEPENDENT VARIABLES INTO LOGISTIC MIXED MODELS. SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC COVARIATES INCLUDED AGE, SEX, RACE/ETHNICITY, EDUCATION, MARITAL STATUS, AND HOUSEHOLD INCOME. OUTCOME VARIABLES INCLUDED ANY RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY ENDORSEMENT (OF 19 ASSESSED), AND SPECIFIC SPORT (SWIMMING, SOCCER, BASEBALL) AND HOBBY (MUSIC, ART) ENDORSEMENTS. RESULTS: IN UNADJUSTED GROUPWISE COMPARISONS, YOUTH WHO SPENT MORE TIME ENGAGING WITH SMA WERE LESS LIKELY TO ENGAGE WITH OTHER RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES (PS <.001). HOWEVER, WHEN VARIANCE IN COGNITION, PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT, AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC COVARIATES WERE ACCOUNTED FOR, MOST FORMS OF SMA WERE NO LONGER SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY ENGAGEMENT (P >.05). SOME MARGINAL EFFECTS WERE OBSERVED: FOR EVERY ONE SD INCREASE IN TIME SPENT ON GAMES AND MOVIES OVER MORE SOCIAL FORMS OF MEDIA, YOUTH WERE AT LOWER ODDS OF ENGAGING IN RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO = 083, 95% CI 076089). LIKEWISE, GREATER GENERAL SMA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER ODDS OF ENDORSING GROUP-BASED SPORTS, INCLUDING SOCCER (093, 088098) AND BASEBALL (092, 086098). MODEL FIT COMPARISONS INDICATED THAT SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, PARTICULARLY SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS, EXPLAINED MORE VARIANCE IN RATES OF RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY ENGAGEMENT THAN SMA AND OTHER LATENT FACTORS.

METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL TELEPHONE SURVEY OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM JUNIOR COMMUNITY FOOTBALL CLUBS ACROSS NEW SOUTH WALES AND VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA, AND PARENTS/CARERS OF JUNIOR CLUB MEMBERS. PARTICIPANTS WERE FROM JUNIOR TEAMS WITH LEVEL 3 ACCREDITATION IN THE GOOD SPORTS PROGRAM. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 79 CLUB REPRESENTATIVES AND 297 PARENTS COMPLETED THE SURVEY. HALF OF PARTICIPATING CLUBS (49%) WERE SPONSORED BY THE ALCOHOL INDUSTRY AND ONE-QUARTER (27%) WERE SPONSORED BY THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY. IN MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES, THE ODDS OF ALCOHOL SPONSORSHIP AMONG RUGBY LEAGUE CLUBS WAS 7.4 (95%CI: 1.831.0, P=<0.006) THAT OF AFL CLUBS, AND CLUBS LOCATED IN REGIONAL AREAS WERE MORE LIKELY THAN THOSE IN MAJOR CITIES TO RECEIVE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY SPONSORSHIP (OR= 9.1; 95%CI: 1.084.0, P=0.05). THE MAJORITY (7881%) OF CLUB REPRESENTATIVES AND PARENTS WERE SUPPORTIVE OF RESTRICTIONS TO PROHIBIT CERTAIN ALCOHOL SPONSORSHIP PRACTICES, BUT A MINORITY (42%) WERE SUPPORTIVE OF RESTRICTIONS TO PROHIBIT CERTAIN FAST FOOD SPONSORSHIP PRACTICES. CONCLUSIONS: LARGE PROPORTIONS OF COMMUNITY SPORTS CLUBS WITH JUNIOR MEMBERS ARE SPONSORED BY THE ALCOHOL INDUSTRY AND THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY. THERE IS GREATER ACCEPTABILITY FOR PROHIBITING SPONSORSHIP FROM THE ALCOHOL INDUSTRY THAN THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY.

METHODS: DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM ONE TEAM (45 ATHLETES) DURING THE 2017 SEASON. SELF-REPORTED WELLNESS WAS COLLECTED DAILY (4, BEST SCORE POSSIBLE; 28, WORST SCORE POSSIBLE). EXTERNAL LOAD/SESSION AVAILABILITY VARIABLES WERE CALCULATED USING GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEMS AND SESSION AVAILABILITY DATA FROM EVERY TRAINING SESSION AND MATCH. ADDITIONAL VARIABLES INCLUDED DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, PRESEASON EXTERNAL LOADS, AND STRENGTH/POWER MEASURES. LINEAR MIXED MODELS WERE BUILT AND COMPARED USING ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR (RMSE) TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF VARIABLES ON WELLNESS. RESULTS: THE EXTERNAL LOAD VARIABLES EXPLAINED WELLNESS TO A LARGE DEGREE (RMSE = 1.55, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS = 1.52 TO 1.57). MODELING ATHLETE ID AS A RANDOM EFFECT APPEARED TO HAVE THE LARGEST IMPACT ON WELLNESS, IMPROVING THE RMSE BY 1.06 POINTS. ASIDE FROM ATHLETE ID, THE VARIABLE THAT HAD THE LARGEST (ALBEIT NEGLIGIBLE) IMPACT ON WELLNESS WAS SPRINT DISTANCE COVERED ACROSS PRESEASON. EVERY ADDITIONAL 2.1 KM COVERED ACROSS PRESEASON WORSENED ATHLETES IN-SEASON WELLNESS SCORES BY 1.2 POINTS (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS = 0.02.3). CONCLUSIONS: THE ISOLATED IMPACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL VARIABLES ON WELLNESS WAS NEGLIGIBLE. HOWEVER, AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR THE INDIVIDUAL ATHLETE VARIABILITY, THE EXTERNAL LOAD VARIABLES EXAMINED COLLECTIVELY WERE ABLE TO EXPLAIN WELLNESS TO A LARGE EXTENT.

"OLIVA-LOZANO JM, 2020, EUR J SPORT SCI";"THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY WERE TO ESTABLISH SOURCES OF VARIABILITY IN MATCH PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL SOCCER PLAYERS AND PROVIDE A METHOD FOR MONITORING INDIVIDUAL BETWEEN-MATCH CHANGES. ELEVEN PLAYERS MEETING THE FINAL INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE MONITORED THROUGH AN ENTIRE IN-SEASON COMPETITION PHASE (N = 240 INDIVIDUAL MATCH OBSERVATIONS). TEN HERTZ GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEMS WERE USED TO MEASURE MATCH TOTAL DISTANCE (TD), TOTAL HIGH-SPEED RUNNING DISTANCE ( 21 KMH1; HSRD), TOTAL ACCELERATIONS (TACC) AND MAXIMUM RUNNING VELOCITY (V MAX). BETWEEN-PLAYER, BETWEEN-POSITION, BETWEEN-MATCH AND WITHIN-PLAYER VARIABILITY WERE DETERMINED THROUGH LINEAR MIXED EFFECTS MODELS. THESE DATA WERE THEN USED TO ESTABLISH THE PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF INDIVIDUAL CHANGES USING A MINIMUM EFFECTS TESTING FRAMEWORK. ALL SOURCES OF VARIABILITY WERE GREATER FOR HSRD (1336%) WHEN COMPARED WITH ALL OTHER METRICS (&LT;6%). USING COMBINED BETWEEN-MATCH AND WITHIN-PLAYER VARIABILITY ALONG WITH THE SMALLEST WORTHWHILE CHANGE (0.2 BETWEEN-PLAYER SD), BETWEEN-MATCH INDIVIDUAL CHANGES OF 1015% IN TD, TACC AND V MAX WERE ESTABLISHED AS PRACTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. FOR HSRD, THESE THRESHOLDS WERE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER (60%). IN CONCLUSION, THE ABILITY FOR SOCCER PRACTITIONERS TO IDENTIFY MEANINGFUL CHANGES IN MATCH PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE CAN AID DECISION MAKING AROUND PLAYER MANAGEMENT FOLLOWING COMPETITION. OUR STUDY PROVIDES A METHOD TO FLAG CHANGES BEYOND THE NORMAL MATCH-TO-MATCH VARIABILITY AND BY A SUBSTANTIAL MAGNITUDE. THIS MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR RECOVERY BUT SHOULD BE COMBINED WITH OTHER SOURCES OF DATA (INTERNAL LOAD AND RESPONSE) AND USED ONLY AS AN ADJUNCT TO PRACTITIONER DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE/EXPERIENCE.

DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WERE USED TO DESCRIBE THE STUDY SAMPLE AND TO CONDUCT BIVARIATE COMPARISONS BY RACE AND AGE COHORT. LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS WERE CONDUCTED IN THE SUBSAMPLE OF RESPONDENTS REPORTING ON DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS USING THE PHQ-9.

INTERACTION TERMS TESTED WHETHER RACE AND AGE MODERATED THE EFFECT OF BODILY PAIN AND FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS ON DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. BIVARIATE ASSOCIATIONS REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOUNGER AND OLDER FORMER PLAYERS IN INDICATORS OF PAIN AND ONLY SLIGHTLY HIGHER FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS AMONG YOUNGER FORMER PLAYERS. IN THE MULTIVARIATE MODELS, PAIN WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS ( = 0.36; P <.01), NET OF A RANGE OF RELEVANT CONTROLS. ADDING AN INDEX OF FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS REDUCED THIS ASSOCIATION BY NEARLY HALF ( = 0.20; P <.01) AND FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS ( = 0.40; P <.01).

OUTCOMES INCLUDED: (1) NUMBER OF CLUBS PERFORMING CARDIAC SCREENING AND FREQUENCY OF SCREENING; (2) EMERGENCY PLANNING AND DOCUMENTATION; (3) AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATOR (AED) TRAINING AND AVAILABILITY; AND (4) PROVISION OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AT SPORTING VENUES. RESULTS 79 CLUBS (86%) RESPONDED TO THE SURVEY. 100% CLUBS PARTICIPATED IN CARDIAC SCREENING. ALL CLUBS HAD AEDS AVAILABLE ON MATCH DAYS AND DURING TRAINING SESSIONS. 100% PREMIERSHIP CLUBS PROVIDED AED TRAINING TO DESIGNATED STAFF. IN CONTRAST, 30% OF LOWER DIVISION CLUBS WITH AEDS AVAILABLE DID NOT PROVIDE FORMAL TRAINING. MOST CLUBS (N=66; 83%) REPORTED THE EXISTENCE OF AN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN FOR SCA BUT FORMAL DOCUMENTATION WAS VARIABLE.

FOOTBALLS POPULARITY AS A SPECTATOR SPORT PROMPTED ITS ORGANISING BODY TO SEEK TO BUILD AN IMPROVED STADIUM, BUT CRICKET AUTHORITIES CONTROLLED THE ASSET AND ACTED TO MAINTAIN ITS SPECIALISED CHARACTER AS A CRICKET GROUND. A CASE STUDY OF HOW THE GAINS FROM A SHARED CAPITAL GOOD ARE NEGOTIATED WHEN ASSET CONTROLLERS AND USERS HAVE DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES IS PROVIDED. A SERIES OF COUNTERFACTUAL SCENARIOS BASED ON FOOTBALL REMAINING AT THE OVAL IS CONSTRUCTED FROM ARCHIVAL SOURCES AND THEIR OUTCOMES PROJECTED BASED ON DATA IN FINANCIAL REPORTS. 2016 INFORMA UK LIMITED, TRADING AS TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP."

PROCESS: FIRSTLY, THE SOURCE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYERS IS ANALYZED IN THE COMPETITION. SECONDLY, A SURVEY OF SOURCES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS AND COPING STRATEGIES ARE CARRIED OUT FOR 21 FOOTBALL PLAYERS FROM SICHUAN UNIVERSITY. THIRDLY, THE RESULTS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS SOURCES AND COPING STRATEGIES ARE OBTAINED. FINALLY, HE METHOD OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAINING FOR SOCCER PLAYERS IS STUDIED. RESULT& ANALYSIS: AFTER THE INVESTIGATION, WE FOUND THAT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYERS IS A VARIETY OF SOURCES IN THE COMPETITION. AMONG THEM, THE GAME'S PRESSURE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT, ACCOUNTING FOR 50%. MOST ATHLETES CAN TAKE POSITIVE COPING STRATEGIES FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS. BUT THERE ARE STILL CLOSE TO 40% OF ATHLETES TO TAKE A NEGATIVE COPING STRATEGIES.

"LAGO-PEAS C, 2015, J SPORTS SCI";"ABSTRACT: THE AIM OF THE CURRENT STUDY WAS (I) TO IDENTIFY HOW IMPORTANT IS A GOOD SEASON START ON ELITE SOCCER TEAMS PERFORMANCE AND (II) TO EXAMINE WHETHER THIS IMPACT IS RELATED TO THE CLUBS FINANCIAL BUDGET. THE MATCH PERFORMANCES AND ANNUAL BUDGETS OF ALL TEAMS WERE COLLECTED FROM THE ENGLISH FA PREMIER LEAGUE, FRENCH LIGUE 1, SPANISH LA LIGA, ITALIAN SERIE A AND GERMAN BUNDESLIGA FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE SEASONS (20102011 TO 20122013). A K-MEANS CLUSTER ANALYSIS CLASSIFIED THE CLUBS ACCORDING TO THEIR BUDGET AS HIGH RANGE BUDGET CLUBS, UPPER-MID RANGE BUDGET CLUBS, LOWER-MID RANGE BUDGET CLUBS AND LOW RANGE BUDGET CLUBS. DATA WERE EXAMINED THROUGH LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS. OVERALL, THE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT THE BETTER THE TEAM PERFORMANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON, THE BETTER THE RANKING AT THE END OF THE SEASON. HOWEVER, THE IMPACT OF THE EFFECT DEPENDED ON THE CLUBS ANNUAL BUDGET, WITH LOWER BUDGETS BEING ASSOCIATED WITH A GREATER IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A GOOD SEASON START (P<0.01). MOREOVER, THERE WERE DIFFERENCES IN TRENDS ACROSS THE DIFFERENT LEAGUES. THESE VARIABLES CAN BE USED TO DEVELOP ACCURATE MODELS TO ESTIMATE FINAL RANKINGS. CONVERSELY, LOWER-MID AND LOWER RANGE BUDGET CLUBS CAN BENEFIT FROM FINE-TUNING PRESEASON PLANNING IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE THE ACQUISITION OF OPTIMAL PERFORMANCES. 2014, 2014 TAYLOR & FRANCIS."

"SONNEMANN U, 2013, PROC NATL ACAD SCI U S A";"A FUNDAMENTAL DEBATE IN SOCIAL SCIENCES CONCERNS HOW INDIVIDUAL JUDGMENTS AND CHOICES, RESULTING FROM PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS, ARE MANIFESTED IN COLLECTIVE ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR. ECONOMISTS EMPHASIZE THE CAPACITY OF MARKETS TO AGGREGATE INFORMATION DISTRIBUTED AMONG TRADERS INTO RATIONAL EQUILIBRIUM PRICES. HOWEVER, PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE IDENTIFIED PERVASIVE AND SYSTEMATIC BIASES IN INDIVIDUAL JUDGMENT THAT THEY GENERALLY ASSUME WILL AFFECT COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR. IN PARTICULAR, RECENT STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT JUDGED LIKELIHOODS OF POSSIBLE EVENTS VARY SYSTEMATICALLY WITH THE WAY THE ENTIRE EVENT SPACE IS PARTITIONED, WITH PROBABILITIES OF EACH OF N PARTITIONED EVENTS BIASED TOWARD 1/N. THUS, COMBINING EVENTS INTO A COMMON PARTITION LOWERS PERCEIVED PROBABILITY, AND UNPACKING EVENTS INTO SEPARATE PARTITIONS INCREASES THEIR PERCEIVED PROBABILITY. WE LOOK FOR EVIDENCE OF SUCH BIAS IN VARIOUS PREDICTION MARKETS, IN WHICH PRICES CAN BE INTERPRETED AS PROBABILITIES OF UPCOMING EVENTS. IN TWO HIGHLY CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES, WE FIND CLEAR EVIDENCE OF PARTITION DEPENDENCE IN A 2-H LABORATORY EXPERIMENT AND A FIELD EXPERIMENT ON NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION (NBA) AND FEDERATION INTERNATIONALE DE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION (FIFA WORLD CUP) SPORTS EVENTS SPANNING SEVERAL WEEKS. WE ALSO FIND EVIDENCE CONSISTENT WITH PARTITION DEPENDENCE IN NONEXPERIMENTAL FIELD DATA FROM PREDICTION MARKETS FOR ECONOMIC DERIVATIVES (GUESSING THE VALUES OF IMPORTANT MACROECONOMIC STATISTICS) AND HORSE RACES. RESULTS IN ANY ONE OF THE STUDIES MIGHT BE EXPLAINED BY A SPECIALIZED ALTERNATIVE THEORY, BUT NO ALTERNATIVE THEORIES CAN EXPLAIN THE RESULTS OF ALL FOUR STUDIES. WE CONCLUDE THAT PSYCHOLOGICAL BIASES IN INDIVIDUAL JUDGMENT CAN AFFECT MARKET PRICES, AND UNDERSTANDING THOSE EFFECTS REQUIRES COMBINING A VARIETY OF METHODS FROM PSYCHOLOGY AND ECONOMICS."
"WALTERS G, 2013, BUS HIST";"THIS STUDY DRAWS ON THE CONCEPT OF 'REGULATORY SPACE' TO ANALYSE THE EVOLUTION OF FINANCIAL REGULATION OF PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL CLUBS IN ENGLAND OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS. IT BEGINS BY SETTING OUT THE INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE INTERNAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OF THE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION. IT THEN DISCUSSES THREE PERIODS THAT DEMONSTRATE HOW THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IS CHARACTERISED AND SHAPED BY DIFFERENT ORGANISATIONS, PARTICULARLY THE FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES. IT CONCLUDES BY ARGUING THAT APPROPRIATE FINANCIAL REGULATION IS UNLIKELY TO OCCUR UNDER THE FOLLOWING FOUR CIRCUMSTANCES: WHERE INTERNAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES OF REGULATORY BODIES ARE CONSTITUTED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO INHIBIT THE PROCESS OF DECISION-MAKING; WHERE POWERFUL ACTORS MAINTAIN CONTROL OF SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND HAVE A DESIRE TO LIMIT FINANCIAL REGULATION; WHERE MINOR ACTORS DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT POWER AND LEVERAGE; AND WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS UNWILLING TO INTERVENE AND USE LEGISLATION. 2013 COPYRIGHT TAYLOR AND FRANCIS GROUP, LLC."

LITTLE IS KNOWN, HOWEVER, ABOUT THE CURRENT STATUS OF SUCH SPONSORSHIP, PARTICULARLY OF COMMUNITY SPORT. THIS STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN ALCOHOL INDUSTRY SPONSORSHIP AND DIFFERENT COMMUNITY FOOTBALL CLUBS IN AUSTRALIA. METHODS: THE STUDY INVOLVED 101 COMMUNITY FOOTBALL CLUBS ACROSS NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA. ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM EACH CLUB TOOK PART IN A CROSS-SECTIONAL TELEPHONE SURVEY DESIGNED TO ASSESS CLUB (FOOTBALL CODE, NUMBER OF PLAYERS, SOCIOECONOMIC AND GEOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTORS) AND ALCOHOL INDUSTRY SPONSORSHIP (MONEY, EQUIPMENT, FREE ALCOHOL OR DISCOUNTED ALCOHOL) CHARACTERISTICS. CHI-SQUARE ANALYSIS WAS USED TO TEST ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CLUB CHARACTERISTICS, AND: I) ANY ALCOHOL INDUSTRY SPONSORSHIP; AND II) TYPE OF SPONSORSHIP. RESULTS: EIGHTY-EIGHT PER CENT OF CLUBS REPORTED RECEIVING SPONSORSHIP FROM THE ALCOHOL INDUSTRY, AND MOST CLUBS (82%) WERE SPONSORED BY A LICENSED PREMISES. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CLUB CHARACTERISTICS AND SOURCE OF ALCOHOL INDUSTRY SPONSORSHIP. HOWEVER, SMALL CLUBS WERE FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE FREE OR DISCOUNTED ALCOHOL SPONSORSHIP THAN LARGER CLUBS (P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY SUGGESTS A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE OF ALCOHOL INDUSTRY SPONSORSHIP AMONG COMMUNITY FOOTBALL CLUBS IN AUSTRALIA."

"ARITUA B, 2008, PROC INST CIV ENG : MANAGE PROC LAW";"THE ENGLISH FOOTBALL PREMIER LEAGUE HAS BECOME THE MOST POPULAR SPORTS LEAGUE IN THE WORLD; WITH ARDENT FANS AND AUDIENCES ALL OVER THE WORLD. THE POTENTIAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES THAT THIS GROWTH HOLDS HAVE THEREFORE ATTRACTED INVESTORS WHO ARE KEEN TO BUY SHARES IN THE CLUBS AND SIGN UP THE BEST FOOTBALLERS THAT MONEY CAN BUY. UNDERPINNING THE GROWTH IN ALL OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE CLUBS IS A DESIRE TO MAKE A DISTINCT STATEMENT OF IDENTITY AS PART OF A COMPETITIVE STRATEGY. ONE WAY TO ACHIEVE THIS IS THROUGH THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF ICONIC FOOTBALL STADIUMS. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE SPECIFIC PROJECT MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH DELIVERY OF ICONIC FOOTBALL STADIUMS IN ENGLAND AND DRAWS LESSONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF SIMILAR ICONIC INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. A STUDY OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICE AND SOME CASE STUDIES SHOWS THAT KEY ISSUES WHICH ARE COMMON TO THESE PROJECTS ARE CENTRED ON DESIGN MANAGEMENT; CHOICE OF PROCUREMENT ROUTE; CLIENT MANAGEMENT; AND STAKEHOLDER EXPECTATION MANAGEMENT. THESE ISSUES ARE NOT NECESSARILY UNIQUE TO THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT OF ICONIC FOOTBALL STADIUMS BUT ARE AMPLIFIED BY THE CONTEXT OF THESE PROJECTS. THE EMPHASIS ON ICONIC STATUS IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET ALSO MEANS THAT STADIUM PROJECTS SHOULD BE CONCEIVED AND DELIVERED IN THE CONTEXT OF OTHER STRATEGIC PROJECTS WHICH SHOULD BE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TEAM."
"CIGADA A, 2008, J PERFORM CONSTR FACIL";"IN THE LAST YEARS AN INCREASING INTEREST HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO ALL THE TOPICS RELATED TO THE SECURITY AND SAFETY OF PEOPLE. PARTICULAR ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO HEALTH MONITORING OF LARGE CIVIL STRUCTURES HOSTING MANY PEOPLE, SUCH AS HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS AND STADIUMS. SOME EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS, SUCH AS THE MILLENNIUM BRIDGE OSCILLATIONS IN LONDON, EXCITED BY PEDESTRIANS, OR THE BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN CONCERT AT THE ULLEVI STADIUM IN WHICH COORDINATED JUMPS FROM THE CROWD CAUSED SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE STRUCTURE, AND DREW ATTENTION TOWARD A DEEPER AND MORE CAREFUL STUDY OF ALL THOSE PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE DYNAMIC BEHAVIOR OF CIVIL STRUCTURES AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH CROWDS. RESEARCH ON THESE TOPICS IS ALSO AIMED, AMONG OTHERS, AT DEVELOPING TECHNIQUES ALLOWING FOR A CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF THE STRUCTURE, STARTING FROM A SET OF MEASUREMENTS THAT CAN BE PERFORMED CONTINUOUSLY, 24 H A DAY, WITHOUT THE NEED TO STOP THE STRUCTURE'S FUNCTIONALITY. THE VAST SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE CONFIRMS THE POSSIBILITY OF RELATING STRUCTURAL HEALTH TO THE EVOLUTION OF MODAL PARAMETERS, OFTEN REACHING THE AIM OF LOCALIZING ANY EVENTUAL DAMAGE, A TASK OTHERWISE IMPOSSIBLE WITH DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES. THIS PAPER SHOWS PART OF A LONG LASTING PROJECT INVOLVING POLITECNICO DI MILANO IN THE SETTING UP OF A PERMANENT HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM AT THE G. MEAZZA STADIUM IN MILAN. THE AIM OF THIS PROJECT WAS THE EVALUATION OF THE ACTUAL HEALTH STATE OF THE STRUCTURES CONSTITUTING THE STANDS OF THE STADIUM AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF A PERMANENT MONITORING SYSTEM TO RECORD THE VIBRATION LEVELS REACHED IN ALL SUBSTRUCTURES DURING EACH EVENT. EVALUATION OF THE ACTUAL STRUCTURE CONDITION WAS PERFORMED BY THE USE OF AMBIENT VIBRATION, WHICH WAS ALSO CHECKED AGAINST TRADITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL MODAL ANALYSIS, PERFORMED BY USING AN INERTIAL FORCE GIVEN BY A HYDRAULIC ACTUATOR AND A DETAILED MEASUREMENT MESH. THIS OFFERED THE CHANCE TO EXPLOIT ALL POSSIBLE INFORMATION CONCERNING NATURAL FREQUENCIES, MODAL SHAPES, AND DAMPING FACTORS. THIS TASK IS EXTREMELY TIME CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE, THEREFORE, IT CANNOT BE REPEATED VERY OFTEN. THE POSSIBILITY OF USING THE DATA COMING FROM THE PERMANENT MONITORING SYSTEM, WHICH IS ABOUT TO BE INSTALLED, IS THEN AN ATTRACTIVE PERSPECTIVE TO IMPROVE STRUCTURAL DIAGNOSIS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT USING OPERATIONAL MODAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES WILL MEAN KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXCITATION APPLIED TO THE STRUCTURE WILL NOT BE REQUIRED. THE PARAMETER ESTIMATION OBTAINED BY THIS TECHNIQUE IS USUALLY AFFECTED BY A SPREAD, GIVEN BOTH BY THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE ADOPTED IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUES AND THE INFLUENCE OF EXTERNAL PARAMETERS, SUCH AS CROWD LOADING OR TEMPERATURE. AS DAMAGE IDENTIFICATION IS RELATED TO CHANGES OF THE MODAL PARAMETERS, THE EVALUATION OF THEIR NORMAL SPREAD IS FUNDAMENTAL TO FIX A THRESHOLD IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE WORRYSOME SITUATIONS. THIS PAPER DEALS WITH THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPREAD IN THE MODAL PARAMETER ESTIMATION OF ONE OF THE GRANDSTANDS OF THE SO-CALLED 3 RING OF THE G. MEAZZA STADIUM IN MILAN, PERFORMED ANALYZING DATA COLLECTED OVER MORE THAN ONE YEAR. VIBRATION DATA HAVE BEEN RECORDED DURING DIFFERENT EVENTS, SUCH AS SOCCER MATCHES AND CONCERTS. THE CONSIDERED DATA CAME FROM A SET OF SENSORS SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH IS TO BE INSTALLED FOR THE PERMANENT MONITORING SYSTEM, TO CHECK ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY TO USE THE MONITORING SYSTEM AS A DIAGNOSTIC TOOL FOR THE STRUCTURE. A STUDY WAS ALSO CARRIED OUT TO IDENTIFY CRITICAL ASPECTS IN THE SENSORS' CHOICE AND THEIR PLACEMENT, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE DESIGN OF THE PERMANENT MONITORING SYSTEM. THE PRESENTED RESULTS CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE CONFIDENCE INTERVALS OUT OF WHICH CHANGES IN THE MODAL PROPERTIES CAN BE CONSIDERED ANOMALOUS, AND SO, WORTHY OF BEING DEEPLY INVESTIGATED TO ASSESS STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY. 2008 ASCE."
